And he happens to have a map that leads to that island. But before he gives it to us, he wants something in return.","Quest.treasureisland.step1":"The map is now in our possession! However, the craftsman cautioned that it can only be used once.

May this panda guide us through the fog of uncertainty.","Quest.drproduct0a_0.step1":"I still find it strange to see a panda on the dragon island.","Quest.drproduct0a_0.step2":"Strange or not, she has stories to tell—about the Holy Dragon that once harvested wheat here.","Quest.drproduct0a_0.step3":"Really? Did she share anything else?","Quest.drproduct0a_0.step4":"Only hints. But she'll reveal more if we take over the wheat harvest in the dragon's absence.","Quest.drproduct0a_0.step5":"Well, we can't leave a mystery unsolved. To the wheat fields we go!","Quest.drcustomermain3_1.step1":"Withered trees, silent gong... Wait, are these dragon footprints?","Quest.drcustomermain3_1.step2":"Indeed these are. Apparently, without the Holy Dragon, everything has fallen apart.","Quest.drcustomermain3_1.step3":"It feels as if life here hinges on the Holy Dragon's presence. We must find it.","Quest.drcustomermain3_1.step4":"And we must also tend to these ruins. There's a balance we need to restore.","Quest.drcustomermain3_1.step5":"Agreed. But let's tread carefully. Who knows what caused this desolation... or where the dragon has gone.","Quest.drproducer2a_0.step1":"We've delivered the wheat as promised. And look, the panda has given us a scroll.","Quest.drproducer2a_0.step2":"She said to take it to the Sacred Lake. Claims it holds the key to restoring harmony.","Quest.drproducer2a_0.step3":"It all sounds very vague... but also intriguing. A mystery wrapped in an enigma.","Quest.drproducer2a_0.step4":"Indeed. Yet, there's a thrill in the unknown. Let's set out for the lake with hopeful hearts.","Quest.drcustomerbridge1_0.step1":"A bridge that's seen better days. Like everything else here... Do you think we can find collateral treasure for all our trouble there?","Quest.drcustomerbridge1_0.step2":"Perhaps. A secret island often holds secrets of its own. Yet, our main quest mustn't be sidelined.","Quest.drcustomerbridge1_0.step3":"Agreed, the dragon remains our priority. But if fortune favors the bold, we might just hit two birds with one stone.","Quest.drcustomerbridge1_0.step4":"Well said. We repair the bridge, uncover what's hidden, and keep our eyes on the prize—the harmony of this realm.","Quest.drcustomerbridge1_0.step5":"Then let's get to work. For treasure, for truth, and for the adventure that beckons us forward!","Quest.drproducer1b_0.step1":"All this renovation work... I'm starting to feel more like a builder than an adventurer. Could there be a shortcut to fix the temple and bring back the dragon?","Quest.drproducer1b_0.step2":"The dragons whispered of a northern nomad with an eagle companion. She might just be our ticket to speeding things up.","Quest.drproducer1b_0.step3":"An eagle-eyed ally in the north? Let's seek her out and barter for information. I am certain that her bird has seen more of these lands than any map could show us.","Quest.drproduct0b_0.step1":"I can't believe we found her before turning into ice sculptures! Do you think it was worth braving the cold?","Quest.drproduct0b_0.step2":"Absolutely. She requested carrots for her eagle companion, and in exchange, we'll receive its magical feathers.","Quest.drproduct0b_0.step3":"Well then, let's make this trade quickly. The sooner we have those feathers, the sooner we can witness their magic at work.","Quest.drproducer2b_0.step1":"The nomad accepted our carrot with a nod. In her silent way, she's given us the topknot feathers.","Quest.drproducer2b_0.step2":"These aren't just any feathers. They hold an aura of ancient magic. But how do we unlock their power?","Quest.drproducer2b_0.step3":"The dragons hinted at a Place of Power. We are to present these feathers there as offerings.","Quest.drproducer2b_0.step4":"Offerings? Then it's not just a trade but a tribute. It's said that the Place of Power rewards those who honor the old ways.","Quest.drproducer2b_0.step5":"Let's make haste then. If we present these feathers with respect, we may just get what we need."},"dragonia_unitStories_json":{"UnitStory.drbattlepass_0.dragonia2.step1":" Welcome back, team. I'm glad you're here.

We don't know what dangers lie ahead.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_3.dragonia2.step1":" This path is getting more dangerous.

We don't know what's out there.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_5.dragonia2.step1":" Look at the size of these vines.

But we need to be careful. The enchantment may have a dangerous side effect.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_7.dragonia2.step1":" The enchantment is stronger than I thought. It's going to take some time to break it.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_7.dragonia2.step2":" We don't have much time.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_7.dragonia2.step3":" I know.

We just need to keep our eyes open.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_11.dragonia2.step1":" Look, up there, on the highest branch!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_11.dragonia2.step2":" That's it! We need to climb up there and get it.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_11.dragonia2.step3":" Be careful, the Tree of Life is not to be trifled with.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_12.dragonia2.step1":" Hold on, what's that sound again?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_12.dragonia2.step2":" It's coming from over there, behind those bushes.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_12.dragonia2.step3":" I sense something powerful nearby.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_12.dragonia2.step4":" Look, there's a hidden passage!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_12.dragonia2.step5":" This could be our chance to find the real flower.

The guardian of the flower.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_16.dragonia2.step2":" That doesn't look friendly.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_16.dragonia2.step3":" We must fight it to protect the flower.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_17.dragonia2.step1":" Wait, let's think for a moment. Maybe there's another way.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_17.dragonia2.step2":" What do you suggest?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_17.dragonia2.step3":" Maybe we can reason with it. After all, it's been protecting the flower for a long time.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_18.dragonia2.step1":" It's worth a shot.

What did it say?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_20.dragonia2.step3":" It said that our intentions are good, but that we must not forget that with great power comes great responsibility.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_20.dragonia2.step4":" Now, let's hurry back and use it to stop the loggers.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_21.dragonia2.step1":"So, how do we use the flower to stop the loggers?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_21.dragonia2.step2":"We have to ground it and spread its particles all over Dragonia from the highest branch of the tree.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_22.dragonia2.step1":"I can see the loggers!

They are going to chop it down any moment now.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_22.dragonia2.step2":"How far are we on grinding the flower so far?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_22.dragonia2.step3":"We're very close!

We deserve a proper feast!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_25.dragonia2.step1":"Once again, thank you for saving our land.

Let's start planting!","UnitStory.drproducertrash_0.dragonia3.step1":"Our progress is steady, but we could use a bit of wisdom to enhance our production.","UnitStory.drproducertrash_0.dragonia3.step2":"There's a sage in the village, an old soul with ancient knowledge. Perhaps he could lend us his expertise.","UnitStory.drproducertrash_0.dragonia3.step3":"An old Chinese sage, you say? They say such sages are bridges to the past, with secrets for the present.","UnitStory.drproducertrash_0.dragonia3.step4":"Let's pay him a visit. The right word from a wise man can often clear the path better than a day's labor.","UnitStory.drproducertrash_0.dragonia3.step5":"To the sage, then. A few moments with him could spare us hours of toil.","UnitStory.drbattlepass1_0.dragonia3.step1":"Doesn't this place look familiar?

We're new to this island.","UnitStory.drbattlepass1_0.dragonia3.step3":"These relics are hard to miss due to their grandeur. Apart from the army, We're looking for The Pagoda, The Dragon, The Garden, and The Castle. We can use stars collected from erecting buildings to restore the relics.","UnitStory.drbattlepass1_0.dragonia3.step4":"Okay, and if we're ever stuck?","UnitStory.drbattlepass1_0.dragonia3.step5":"We have the ultimate guide - just a tap away. It'll show us where to find what we need and how to use it.","UnitStory.drbattlepass1_5.dragonia3.step1":"Marvel at our work! From raw earth to a silent battalion standing guard. The Terracotta Army is complete.","UnitStory.drbattlepass1_5.dragonia3.step2":"A sight to behold indeed. And if legend holds true, this army is but one of many secrets buried in the folds of Dragon Island.","UnitStory.drbattlepass1_5.dragonia3.step3":"Then this is just the beginning. With the army complete, who knows what other ancient structures await our touch?","UnitStory.drbattlepass1_5.dragonia3.step4":"Let's keep our eyes open as we journey. If this island is truly a canvas of hidden wonders, we shall be the ones to uncover them all.","UnitStory.drbattlepass2_5.dragonia3.step1":"Behold, the pagoda stands complete! A magnificent addition to Dragon Island's landscape.","UnitStory.drbattlepass2_5.dragonia3.step2":"Truly a cause for celebration. Our efforts have borne fruit, and this structure now stands as a beacon of our journey.","UnitStory.drbattlepass2_5.dragonia3.step3":"Yet, I can't help but feel this is just the beginning. The island still holds many secrets, many more structures to unveil.","UnitStory.drbattlepass2_5.dragonia3.step4":"Agreed. Each building we erect is a step deeper into the island's lore. Our adventure is far from over.","UnitStory.drbattlepass3_5.dragonia3.step1":"The statue is restored! Once again, the imperial dragon stands tall, a majestic sight to behold.","UnitStory.drbattlepass3_5.dragonia3.step2":"Our efforts have breathed new life into this ancient guardian. It feels like we've rekindled a piece of the island's soul.","UnitStory.drbattlepass3_5.dragonia3.step3":"But our journey doesn't end here. The island still whispers of untold projects, waiting for our touch.","UnitStory.drbattlepass4_5.dragonia3.step1":"The garden is ready! Every element is in place, achieving perfect harmony. A true oasis of peace.","UnitStory.drbattlepass4_5.dragonia3.step2":"It's more than just a garden; it's a testament to balance and beauty. We've really outdone ourselves this time.","UnitStory.drbattlepass4_5.dragonia3.step3":"But is our work here truly over? Dragon Island still holds so many mysteries, so many paths untraveled.","UnitStory.drbattlepass4_5.dragonia3.step4":"You're right. While we've achieved harmony here, the island's whispers still call to us, beckoning us to new adventures.","UnitStory.drbattlepass4_5.dragonia3.step5":"Then let's answer that call. Our journey continues, as long as there's a mystery to solve, a story to uncover.","UnitStory.drbattlepass5_5.dragonia3.step1":"It's done. The castle stands majestic and proud. Our journey's work is now a part of the island's skyline.","UnitStory.drbattlepass5_5.dragonia3.step2":"And the rewards we've gathered are bountiful. But truly, being part of this journey... that's the real treasure.","UnitStory.drbattlepass5_5.dragonia3.step3":"Absolutely. The skills we've honed, the secrets we've uncovered, the bond we've forged with this land and each other...","UnitStory.drbattlepass5_5.dragonia3.step4":"It's more than I ever imagined when we first set foot on Dragon Island. We've built structures, but also, we've built memories.","UnitStory.drbattlepass5_5.dragonia3.step5":"Let's take a moment to cherish this. We've done something extraordinary. And while our work here is complete, the adventure... it never really ends.","UnitStory.drproduct2a_0.dragonia3.step1":"Panda was right. Reading the contents of the scroll by the sacred lake revealed the truth.","UnitStory.drproduct2a_0.dragonia3.step2":"It's dragon crystal – rarest mineral in whole of Dragonia. I am not surprised that this is the only thing that can bring the Holy Dragon back.","UnitStory.drproduct2a_0.dragonia3.step3":"Let's collect as many of them as we can and apply them. If we don't return the dragon in time, this realm will be forever lost.","UnitStory.drcustomermain3_1.dragonia3.step1":"I can't believe my eyes! We managed to bring the Holy Dragon back.","UnitStory.drcustomermain3_1.dragonia3.step2":"He said that he was possesed by an evil witch and is very thankful for his salvation. He will grant his ultimate treasure island once the Holy area is fully restored.","UnitStory.drcustomermain3_1.dragonia3.step3":"That's very nice of him. But we should be careful from now on. Who know's what is the evil witch is capable of now that she lost her catch.","UnitStory.drproducer2a_0.dragonia3.step1":"This must be the Sacred Lake, shimmering with a light that seems to dance on the water's surface.","UnitStory.drproducer2a_0.dragonia3.step2":"It's exactly as the panda described. Speaking of which, isn't this the place where we're supposed to read the scroll she gave us?","UnitStory.drproducer2a_0.dragonia3.step3":"Yes, you're right. The scroll's secrets are to be revealed here. The waters might hold the key to decoding its mysteries.","UnitStory.drproducer2b_0.dragonia3.step1":"This must be the Place of Power. It feels charged with an ancient energy.","UnitStory.drproducer2b_0.dragonia3.step2":"The perfect spot to present the magical feathers. The air's almost humming with anticipation.","UnitStory.drproducer2b_0.dragonia3.step3":"Let's do this with reverence. These feathers are more than just gifts; they're symbols of our journey and respect for this land.","UnitStory.drproducer0a_0.dragonia3.step1":"Here they are, the wheat beds. This is what the panda sought.","UnitStory.drproducer0a_0.dragonia3.step2":"They've been untended for some time. The dragon's absence is felt even in the grain.","UnitStory.drproducer0a_0.dragonia3.step3":"Let's get to work then.

Is that a castle gleaming under the moonlight?","Quest.hlcastle_find.step2":"It seems so! But it doesn’t look quite right for this spooky season, does it?","Quest.hlcastle_find.step3":"You’re right. It’s oddly bright and cheerful... Almost enchanting in a non-spooky way.","Quest.hlcastle_find.step4":"We should get a closer look. Maybe there is a tiny spider web or a baby ghost not visible from afar...","Quest.hlcastle_0.step1":"On the second thought, even if we hang a bat in one of the corners, the castle will still look too cheerful, don't you agree?","Quest.hlcastle_0.step2":"You’re right. There’s a persistent aura of enchantment that our decorations alone cannot dispel.","Quest.hlcastle_0.step3":"This must be the work of a potent spell, something that mere decorations cannot counteract.","Quest.hlcastle_0.step4":"Disenchanting a fairy’s work is tricky... We’ll need help from the mystical beings of the island.","Quest.hlcastle_0.step5":"Let’s embark on a quest, then! We must find someone who can help us lift the spell and bring the full spooky back to this castle in time for Halloween!","Quest.hlcastle_1.step1":"It's obvious, though, that mere decorations won't break the spell. The fairy’s enchantment is deeply woven into the castle’s very stones.","Quest.hlcastle_1.step2":"Our quest continues, then. To truly bring the Halloween spirit to this castle, we must delve deeper into the mysteries of disenchantment alongside our new allies.","Quest.hlcastle_2.step1":"Look at how far we’ve come! The castle, once cheerfully enchanted, now begins to whisper tales of the eerie and the unknown.","Quest.hlcastle_2.step2":"Indeed, each cobweb and shadow brings us closer to a true Halloween spectacle. But the final threads of the enchantment still linger.","Quest.hlcastle_2.step3":"The fairy’s magic is potent, but we’ve gathered allies, knowledge, and spooky decorations that have begun to pierce through its cheerful veil.","Quest.hlcastle_2.step4":"We are on the brink! Let’s muster our courage, gather our wits, and dispel the remaining enchantment to unveil a castle truly fit for Halloween!","Quest.hlhag_0.step1":"To disenchant the castle, we’ll need potent magic, something beyond our abilities.","Quest.hlhag_0.step2":"I’ve heard tales of a local Alchemist, dwelling deep within the mystical woods, who possesses the power to counter even the strongest enchantments.","Quest.hlhag_0.step3":"Ah, the Alchemist of the woods! Legends say she can brew potions to alter any spell or curse.","Quest.hlhag_0.step4":"Then our path is clear. We must seek her out and plead for her assistance to bring the spooky back to our castle!","Quest.hlflittermouse_3.step1":"Now that we’re closer, it’s clear something’s amiss. This castle is devoid of any Halloween fright!","Quest.hlflittermouse_3.step2":"It’s as if a fairy has washed away every ounce of spookiness with a wave of her wand!","Quest.hlflittermouse_3.step3":"We can’t let it stay this way, especially not with Halloween around the corner. It needs its eerie charm back.","Quest.hlflittermouse_3.step4":"While we ponder on a bigger solution, let's start by adding our own spooky touches to the castle.","Quest.hlflittermouse_3.step5":"A splendid idea! A bat, with its shadowy figure flapping amidst the castle’s towers, would surely add a creepy vibe.","Quest.hlcaldron_7.step1":"I braved the shadows and spoke to the Alchemist of the woods...","Quest.hlcaldron_7.step2":"The suspense is killing us!

They speak of a Halloween gnome, shrouded in mystery and playful mischief, lurking amidst the shadows and enchantments!","Quest.hlgnome_2.step3":"The trees hint at a reward, a landmark for our main land, should we manage to find this elusive creature during our spooky endeavors.","Quest.hlgnome_2.step4":"A landmark, the Halloween Castle, that will stand as a testament to our adventures, echoing the eerie and mystical in every crevice of our domain!","Quest.hlgnome_2.step5":"Let’s weave this new thread into our tale, seeking the gnome to forever embed the spirit of this Halloween quest into our main land!","Quest.hlmummie_0.step1":"Having the Alchemist of the woods as an ally is a boon, but in this mystical endeavor, additional allies wouldn’t be amiss.","Quest.hlmummie_0.step2":"Indeed, more friends on this eerie journey could tilt the scales in our favor.","Quest.hlmummie_0.step3":"Tales from my childhood speak of a forest mummy, shrouded in ancient linens and lingering amidst the twisted trees.","Quest.hlmummie_0.step4":"Perhaps this mummy holds secrets or powers that could aid us.","Quest.hlmummie_0.step5":"I always thought of it as a bedtime story meant to instill fear and excitement. But now, wandering through these mystical woods, the legend seems all too plausible...","Quest.hlspider_3.step1":"Although the bat adds a touch of the eerie, this castle still lacks the chilling charm of Halloween!","Quest.hlspider_3.step2":"You’re right. One bat won’t undo a fairy’s enchantment. But perhaps, adding a spider, weaving its silken threads, might amplify the spookiness a bit?","Quest.hlspider_3.step3":"Indeed, a spider weaving a web in the moonlight can cast the most haunting shadows. But where can we find one in these enchanted woods?","Quest.hlspider_3.step4":"Let's ask one of our new spooky friends for help! They might know where to find a spider to add to our growing collection of eerie decorations.","Quest.hlcandle_3.step1":"The spider, with its nimble legs, has begun to weave a tapestry of webs around the castle!","Quest.hlcandle_3.step2":"A splendid, spooky sight indeed! But the ambiance still lacks a certain... spectral glow, wouldn’t you say?","Quest.hlcandle_3.step3":"Ah, you’ve hit the nail on the coffin! What we need are candles, but not just any candles - they must cast an eerie light to truly bring forth the Halloween spirit!","Quest.hlcandle_3.step4":"A quest for the spectral candles it is, then!

It was found by your ancestors. Generations ago.","UnitStory.hlbattlepass_4.step3":"So I am not the first one from my family to celebrate Halloween here?","UnitStory.hlbattlepass_4.step4":"No. As I said before, it’s a long-lasting tradition. And you’re a part of it now!","UnitStory.hlbattlepass_5.step1":"Can we invite others to help us prepare for the celebration?","UnitStory.hlbattlepass_5.step2":"Great idea!

We find the note - we find our friend. Luck is finally on our side!","UnitStory.hlbattlepass_21.step1":"I guess we’re out of luck again.

The mummy will help us find a bat for the castle, but it seeks a magic elixir in return for its guidance.","UnitStory.hlmummie_0.step4":"Accidentally, we already know someone who is good with elixirs!","UnitStory.hlcaldron_7.step1":"The cauldron, aged and seasoned with countless spells, is finally in our possession!","UnitStory.hlcaldron_7.step2":"A triumph indeed! Now, the alchemist can brew her potent concoctions once more.","UnitStory.hlcaldron_7.step3":"But we mustn’t forget, the elixir for the mummy requires specific, perhaps enigmatic, ingredients.","UnitStory.hlcaldron_7.step4":"True, we must scour the land, from murky swamps to enchanted groves, to gather what is needed for the brew.","UnitStory.hlflittermouse_0.step1":"Behold, the bat egg, a rarity in our mystical realm, now lies within our grasp!","UnitStory.hlflittermouse_0.step2":"A monumental find! The mummy held true to its word, guiding us to this precious beginning.","UnitStory.hlflittermouse_0.step3":"I hope it enjoyed every last drop of the elixir.

Yet, even as the bat will soon take wing, our journey is far from its end.","UnitStory.hlspider_0.step1":"Look at this, a spider egg, delicately wrapped in the finest of silken threads, now in our hands!","UnitStory.hlspider_0.step2":"An eerie yet exciting discovery! These eight-legged architects will surely spin a web of fright throughout the castle!","UnitStory.hlspider_0.step3":"I can already imagine the moonlight gently illuminating the delicate, dew-kissed webs on a crisp Halloween night.","UnitStory.hlspider_0.step4":"And think of the shadows they'll cast! But let’s not get too entwined in the future, our quest is still weaving its path ahead of us.","UnitStory.hlcandle_0.step1":"Ah-ha! The first light, a beacon in our dark quest, is now found!","UnitStory.hlcandle_0.step2":"Its ghostly glow pierces through the darkness, promising to cast eerie shadows across our castle!","UnitStory.hlcandle_0.step3":"But one light alone cannot dispel the lingering cheerfulness of the fairy’s enchantment. We must seek the candelabra to amplify its spectral glow.","UnitStory.hlcandle_0.step4":"Indeed, the eerie candelabra, legendary for its haunting luminescence, will be the key to enveloping the castle in a truly spooky aura!","UnitStory.hlgnome_0.step1":"Wow, we've uncovered the first stage of the Halloween gnome!","UnitStory.hlgnome_0.step2":"Oh, this is thrilling!

I was kind of thinking that it was perfect for you.","Quest.stone_3.step3":"If we have to rebuild our Kingdom from scratch I'll make sure that I have the biggest palace.","Quest.stone_4.step1":"I can't believe that I'm saying this but you were actually right. It is prefect for me. I'll use it as a shed for keeping old things.","Quest.stone_4.step2":"As you wish. Although, I know that you don't have anything since the invaders took everything away, remember?","Quest.stone_5.step1":"This is looking wonderful. Whom should I thank for such a great architectural achievement?","Quest.stone_5.step2":"You should thank all of us, your highness. And be sure that we're capable of even greater things.","Quest.stone_6.step1":"We could use it as a watchtower to look after evil creatures so they stay under control.","Quest.stone_6.step2":"For the time being, yes. But since we are planning to have an army of our own we'll need a place to feed the soldiers...","Quest.stone_7.step1":"This tavern looks delicious. Should I go in there and test it out?","Quest.stone_7.step2":"Not before we rebuild it and turn into something else.","Quest.stone_8.step1":"How do you like it now?","Quest.stone_8.step2":"You ruined a perfectly nice building but I'll get over it. Eventually. When I eat something.","Quest.stone_10.step1":"This is it. This citadel will mark the beginning of the new Farawake Kingdom. Even stronger and more prosperous one.","Quest.stone_10.step2":"Your spirit and belief is what keeps us going.","Quest.stone_10.step3":"I know that there aren't many of us yet but we can do great things together.","Quest.wagon_1.step1":"Is there anyone in our team who can work with metal?","Quest.wagon_1.step2":"Don't look at me. I've done the most important part already. I rescued you.","Quest.wagon_1.step3":"I don't know if you could tell by my armor but I happen to know a thing or two about alloys.","Quest.wagon_2.step1":"So, what do we do about those beams?","Quest.wagon_2.step2":"They'll make a great foundation for our future buildings. Let's get some more!","Quest.wagon_3.step1":"Are you building an igloo? I didn't know that you were a polar bear...","Quest.wagon_3.step2":"You could've actually learned something if you were using your eyes instead of your mouth more often.","Quest.wagon_4.step1":"Grizzly, is this is what I think it is?","Quest.wagon_4.step2":"Yes, sir. I figured that we might need something like this in our situation.","Quest.wagon_4.step3":"What is it? I don't understand.","Quest.wagon_4.step4":"Once again, more watching, less talking.","Quest.wagon_5.step1":"Alright, now I see.","Quest.wagon_5.step2":"I'm curious. What do you see?","Quest.wagon_5.step3":"Okay, you got me. Still no idea.","Quest.wagon_5.step4":"Be patient, my friend. Just help me get more resources and soon you will see everything.","Quest.wagon_6.step1":"You might not know that but Grizzly comes from a very long line of scientists.","Quest.wagon_6.step2":"Really? You don't say. He looks more like a warrior.","Quest.wagon_6.step3":"I'm many things but my heart will always belong to knowledge. I hope that you'll like my new laboratory.","Quest.wagon_7.step1":"This looks nice. What are you planning on doing with it?","Quest.wagon_7.step2":"First off, I got to finish building it so your help will be much appreciated.","Quest.wagon_8.step1":"I got a little hungry from being so overly helpful and I was wondering if there is a way for you to create something tasty and filling in there?","Quest.wagon_8.step2":"Don't mind him. He always talks about food. Is there anything else we can do?","Quest.wagon_8.step3":"It's okay. Thank you. I'll try and make something when we're done.","Quest.wagon_10.step1":"This is where I'm going to build my laboratory. What do you think?","Quest.wagon_10.step2":"I think it's a great solution. Even if it's not we can always put it somewhere else.","Quest.wagon_10.step3":"Yeah, you can always count on us. We've got your back!","Quest.elf_1.step1":"Are there any hunters among us?","Quest.elf_1.step2":"Why do you ask?","Quest.elf_1.step3":"I've found an arrow.","Quest.elf_1.step4":"It's too early to jump to conclusions. Let's collect some more and see what happens.","Quest.elf_2.step1":"I'm not even sure if anyone here is any good at archery.","Quest.elf_2.step2":"Why would anyone want a bow if you've got a saw?","Quest.elf_2.step3":"Or a hammer?","Quest.elf_2.step4":"I had my share of doubts but now I'm almost certain that this quiver belongs to a more sophisticated being than us.","Quest.elf_3.step1":"What if nobody comes to claim those arrows? Can I keep them then?","Quest.elf_3.step2":"Why do you even want them? They aren't edible.","Quest.elf_3.step3":"I'm going to use them as a big, nice fork.","Quest.elf_4.step1":"What if nobody comes to claim those arrows? Can I keep them then?","Quest.elf_4.step2":"Why do you even want them? They aren't edible.","Quest.elf_4.step3":"I'm going to use them as a big, nice fork.","Quest.elf_5.step1":"The more arrows we find the scarier it becomes.","Quest.elf_5.step2":"And why is that?","Quest.elf_5.step3":"What if their owner decides to use them against us?","Quest.elf_5.step4":"I guess you were also scared when you saw me for the first time. Look at us now. Thick as thieves!","Quest.elf_6.step1":"Does it get any better than this? Who wouldn't want to have such a gorgeous bow?","Quest.elf_6.step2":"What do you know about bows? And, most of all, about beauty? Let's just wait for the owner to reveal herself.","Quest.warlock_1.step1":"Great news! I think I've just found a new recipe. I can finally cook something new.","Quest.warlock_1.step2":"Let me see. Hm... It's not a recipe for a dish. It's a recipe for a potion.","Quest.warlock_1.step3":"I didn't know there were witches allowed into the Farawake Kingdom.","Quest.warlock_1.step4":"Maybe she is not from around here...","Quest.warlock_2.step1":"Can anyone speak ancient languages?","Quest.warlock_2.step2":"No, why do you ask?","Quest.warlock_2.step3":"I've just found the second variable of that magical equation and kind of want to read what's on it.","Quest.warlock_2.step4":"I don't think that it's such a good idea. We wouldn't know what to do with it even if we were proficient in the languages required.","Quest.warlock_3.step1":"I wonder who is the owner of these books. I've never seen anything like it before.","Quest.warlock_3.step2":"That's what we thought when we've found your bow.","Quest.warlock_3.step3":"It's funny how you're always unable to use the things you find.","Quest.warlock_4.step1":"I wonder who is the owner of these books. I've never seen anything like it before.","Quest.warlock_4.step2":"That's what we thought when we've found your bow.","Quest.warlock_4.step3":"It's funny how you're always unable to use the things you find.","Quest.warlock_5.step1":"How many more spells are out there? Because I keep on finding these books...","Quest.warlock_5.step2":"Does it really matter? We all know that you can't even read them. Leave them be.","Quest.warlock_5.step3":"I'll keep looking till I find something that I can read.","Quest.warlock_6.step1":"Grizzly, what do you make of these books from the scientific point of view?","Quest.warlock_6.step2":"I'd rather not say because I don't want to offend anyone.","Quest.warlock_6.step3":"Interesting. Now I'm even more curious to see this so-called witch. ","Quest.warlock_7.step1":"Does anyone want to give up? We've been carrying those books around for too long. And they're not getting lighter.","Quest.warlock_7.step2":"We owe it to their owner to save her. Trust me, I've been there. It's not a nice feeling to be captured.","Quest.magicplant_1.step1":"Look what I've found!","Quest.magicplant_1.step2":"How come you keep on finding things?","Quest.magicplant_1.step3":"It's easy, my friend. I'm just always looking for food.","Quest.magicplant_2.step1":"Do you have any idea what this is?","Quest.magicplant_2.step2":"No, I've never seen anything like it before.","Quest.magicplant_2.step3":"Maybe you can taste it and tell us what it feels like.","Quest.magicplant_2.step4":"I know that I've got a reputation but even I'm scared of eating something so unfamiliar.","Quest.magicplant_3.step1":"I'm so glad that I didn't try and eat it. It started to glow!","Quest.magicplant_3.step2":"It would've been funny to watch your huge belly being lit up on the inside. An oversized human torch, if I may.","Quest.magicplant_4.step1":"So, what should we do about it?","Quest.magicplant_4.step2":"Why are you asking me? I don't know.","Quest.magicplant_4.step3":"Because you're an expert when it comes to trees.","Quest.magicplant_4.step4":"Yes, when it comes to cutting them down. This one looks like it would be wasted on firewood.","Quest.magicplant_5.step1":"It's getting bigger and bigger each time. When does it stop?","Quest.magicplant_5.step2":"I don't know but I bet you that it's not over yet.","Quest.magicplant_5.step3":"Alright, but if it is you're cooking tonight.","Quest.magicplant_6.step1":"I have an ingenious idea!  We should read about this plant in the book.","Quest.magicplant_6.step2":"Great plan! Although there is one little problem. None of us can read.","Quest.magicplant_6.step3":"That's right... How could I forget about it!","Quest.magicplant_6.step4":"Not so sharp for a genius, are you?","Quest.magicplant_7.step1":"Wow, look how beautiful it is. Only something good can come out of something as pretty.","Quest.magicplant_7.step2":"Let's find out if you're right!","Quest.magicplant_8.step1":"Am I seeing this right?","Quest.magicplant_8.step2":"No, these flowers aren't for eating.","Quest.magicplant_8.step3":"What are they for then?","Quest.magicplant_8.step4":"I think they're for granting wishes.","Quest.troll_1.step1":"It looks like your dream is coming true. How would you like a new instrument?","Quest.troll_1.step2":"I don't feel like taking someone else's axe. Let's find its actual owner.","Quest.troll_2.step1":"Maybe you will be more compliant and accept my offer of becoming this axe's new master?","Quest.troll_2.step2":"I am pretty happy with my hammer, thank you. Why do you want to get rid of it so much?","Quest.troll_2.step3":"I don't want to starve to death while looking for the one who lost it.","Quest.troll_2.step4":"Don't worry. I'll help you to make things go faster.","Quest.troll_3.step1":"Our team is getting bigger. How are you going to feel when you're not the only one who knows his way around sharp tools?","Quest.troll_3.step2":"I'll feel great. There will finally be someone to talk to rather than you.","Quest.troll_4.step1":"It's important to be prepared. We don't know if it's a trap or not. Maybe someone is playing with us.","Quest.troll_4.step2":"I don't sense any dark magic surrounding this axe. I have a reason to believe that we're on the right path.","Quest.troll_4.step3":"I hope so but let's keep an eye on each other anyway.","Quest.troll_5.step1":"So, how do you know the axe owner? I thought that archery lovers do not hobnob with others.","Quest.troll_5.step2":"And yet, here I am, talking to you.","Quest.troll_5.step3":"I'm serious. Who is he?","Quest.troll_5.step4":"He is a great hunter. If anyone can help you catch some food for dinner, it's him.","Quest.troll_6.step1":"So, how do you know the axe owner? I thought that archery lovers do not hobnob with others.","Quest.troll_6.step2":"And yet, here I am, talking to you.","Quest.troll_6.step3":"I'm serious. Who is he?","Quest.troll_6.step4":"He is a great hunter. If anyone can help you catch some food for dinner, it's him.","Quest.troll_7.step1":"Look how fancy these axes are! Are you sure you don't want to take one? Who needs two axes?","Quest.troll_7.step2":"Someone who is strong enough to hold both of them.","Quest.troll_8.step1":"I was always wondering, your majesty, what is the weapon of your choice? Could it be an axe by any chance?","Quest.troll_8.step2":"A wise king will do everything in his power to avoid the battle. That's why I always have to keep my brain sharper than any sword.","Quest.bamboo_1.step1":"I have the greatest of news, Grizzly! There is something that will make your stay here much better.","Quest.bamboo_1.step2":"I'm sorry to disappoint you but you're confusing me with someone. I'm acquainted with some pandas but I'm not one myself.","Quest.bamboo_1.step3":"Maybe you should learn from them. After all, normal food is always scarce when the Rider is around.","Quest.bamboo_2.step1":"Why do we need this bamboo anyway if Grizzly is not going to eat it?","Quest.bamboo_2.step2":"Don't you remember? I can build anything out of anything. Let's find some more!","Quest.bamboo_3.step1":"Okay, I get that you don't find it tasty but will you consider living in a house made out of bamboo?","Quest.bamboo_3.step2":"Sure, why not. If it's big enough to accommodate me.","Quest.bamboo_3.step3":"Did you hear that? Let's build a mansion for our friend!","Quest.bamboo_4.step1":"I've heard that some warriors use bamboo sticks as their weapons. Are you considering doing the same?","Quest.bamboo_4.step2":"It might be good for combat but I'm more into hunting. So the answer is no.","Quest.bamboo_4.step3":"Got it. Maybe we can build you a shed big enough to store all of your bows and arrows.","Quest.bamboo_5.step1":"I like what you're doing here. The more buildings we have the mightier our forces will be. How many more can you erect?","Quest.bamboo_5.step2":"It depends on how much more materials can we find.","Quest.bamboo_5.step3":"Well, in that case, spare no expense but find what we need. Use all the help you need.","Quest.bamboo_6.step1":"I can't believe I'm saying this but I need you to look for food.","Quest.bamboo_6.step2":"And I can't believe my ears! I'm finally not the only one who is hungry all the time.","Quest.bamboo_6.step3":"Yes, you still are. I was just hoping that you'll accidentally help me find more bamboo while searching for sustenance.","Quest.bamboo_7.step1":"I don't get it. Why do we use bamboo for construction when we have stone, metal, and wood? Aren't they more resilient?","Quest.bamboo_7.step2":"Yes, they might be. But we don't have a choice. Our lands are spoiled with different kinds of creatures that we have to cut down.","Quest.bamboo_7.step3":"And it would be a waste not to use what's left of them. Everything is valuable when rebuilding our kingdom.","Quest.bamboo_8.step1":"I had no idea that you can erect a building so big and massive using... bamboo.","Quest.bamboo_8.step2":"Well, my friend, when you have enough of something and you know how to use it miracles do happen. Wait until you see the next one!","Quest.bamboo_10.step1":"You weren't lying. This is amazing. I might reconsider relocating here from my current living quarters.","Quest.bamboo_10.step2":"I wouldn't advise you to live in a house that can theoretically be eaten. You might not be a panda but your appetite is unpredictable.","Quest.sapphire_1.step1":"Remember you told me that you can build anything out of anything?","Quest.sapphire_1.step2":"Of course. I don't use words lightly like some other members of our crew.","Quest.sapphire_1.step3":"Then I have a challenge for you if you choose to accept it!","Quest.sapphire_2.step1":"Do you still think that you're up for the task?","Quest.sapphire_2.step2":"I am. And I'll finish faster if you stop talking and start helping me collect more materials.","Quest.sapphire_3.step1":"Doesn't it look fragile to you?","Quest.sapphire_3.step2":"Do not underestimate crystals. The more buildings we made using them the safer our Kingdom is going to be.","Quest.sapphire_4.step1":"What is it that you're building, guys?","Quest.sapphire_4.step2":"Gingerbeard is desperately trying to prove that he doesn't waste his words.","Quest.sapphire_4.step3":"I'm not trying to prove it. I am actually doing it.","Quest.sapphire_5.step1":"This looks pretty. Although I would never think that you made it.","Quest.sapphire_5.step2":"Why is that?","Quest.sapphire_5.step3":"I don't mean to be rude but you don't look like someone capable of crafting sophisticated buildings like that.","Quest.sapphire_6.step1":"Okay, you've got yourself a deal. I am going to help you under one condition...","Quest.sapphire_6.step2":"I'm doing pretty good on my own. I don't think that I need your help.","Quest.sapphire_6.step3":"It's too late now. I am helping you anyway in exchange for one of these villas. Emeralda seems to like them and I... Hm. I really like her.","Quest.sapphire_7.step1":"Did you tell anyone else about your secret?","Quest.sapphire_7.step2":"No! And if you do I will... I will eat your saw!","Quest.sapphire_7.step3":"Don't worry, it's safe with me. Actually, I find it very romantic. Let's build a real castle for her!","Quest.sapphire_8.step1":"Hey, Grizzly, can you give us a hand? We tried to bite off more than we could chew.","Quest.sapphire_8.step2":"Don't say that you want me to carry materials for you again! I'm a strong and independent bear but I do have feelings too, you know.","Quest.sapphire_8.step3":"Of course. And we wouldn't want to hurt them. We're having a tea party with honey and jam afterward and you're invited!","Quest.sapphire_8.step4":"Why didn't you start with that?! What and where do you need me to carry?","Quest.sapphire_9.step1":"So, what are you going to do? Just give her the keys and say \"It's your castle now, enjoy\"?","Quest.sapphire_9.step2":"I didn't think it through. I'm not good with words, you know that better than anyone.","Quest.sapphire_9.step3":"Maybe we should ask the King? It's his job to be eloquent.","Quest.sapphire_9.step4":"I'm not ready to share my darkest secret with two people in one day. I'll wing it!","Quest.sapphire_11.step1":"How do you like this castle?","Quest.sapphire_11.step2":"It's beautiful. Gingerbeard did a great job.","Quest.sapphire_11.step3":"I've helped him, actually. He said that he couldn't do it without me.","Quest.sapphire_11.step4":"Really? Well, I hope you realize that I was being sarcastic when calling it pretty. My favorite color is green, not purple. Better luck next time.","Quest.knight_1.step1":"Your Majesty! Finally, something that deserves your attention.","Quest.knight_1.step2":"Thank you kindly but I'm perfectly happy with my sword as it is. Although I'm curious to see where this peculiar item is going to bring us.","Quest.knight_2.step1":"How are you feeling about another weapon in our collection? I remember when I first found your ax. It got me scared.","Quest.knight_2.step2":"Fangtooth is scared of nothing. And he will protect his scared friends.","Quest.knight_2.step3":"Wow, when did we manage to become friends?","Quest.knight_2.step4":"You're still here. That makes you a friend of Fangtooth.","Quest.knight_3.step1":"Grizzly, you're a bear of science, aren't you?","Quest.knight_3.step2":"Indeed I am. What is your point?","Quest.knight_3.step3":"Do you happen to know what's more resilient, a sword or a hammer?","Quest.knight_3.step4":"A usual sword would beat your normal hammer. But my hammer is beyond normal. And it will beat any sword, even an extraordinary one.","Quest.knight_4.step1":"Are you doing okay?","Quest.knight_4.step2":"Yes. Totally. I'm great. I'm fine. Why do you ask?","Quest.knight_4.step3":"Another potential member of our team is on the way. What if he likes Emeralda too...","Quest.knight_4.step4":"Actually, it doesn't bother me at all. As long as we don't stumble on a crossbow I have nothing to worry about.","Quest.knight_5.step1":"Are you doing okay?","Quest.knight_5.step2":"Yes. Totally. I'm great. I'm fine. Why do you ask?","Quest.knight_5.step3":"Another potential member of our team is on the way. What if he likes Emeralda too...","Quest.knight_5.step4":"Actually, it doesn't bother me at all. As long as we don't stumble on a crossbow I have nothing to worry about.","Quest.knight_6.step1":"Can you say anything about this sword just by looking at it?","Quest.knight_6.step2":"I'm not a psychic, you know. Why are you so curious anyway?","Quest.knight_6.step3":"No reason. I just want to be prepared for anything.","Quest.knight_7.step1":"Do you think I should get a weapon too?","Quest.knight_7.step2":"I don't even think that you can use one properly.","Quest.knight_7.step3":"That is so mean of you. I can handle this sword even better than its current owner!","Quest.knight_7.step4":"We'll see about that very soon, won't we?","Quest.knight_8.step1":"You really got me thinking about this sword so I investigated it. Turns out it's made out of dragon steel.","Quest.knight_8.step2":"Is it a good or a bad thing?","Quest.knight_8.step3":"It means that it will beat my hammer 10 times out of 10...","Quest.knight_9.step1":"Now I know enough about my future nemesis to compete with him!","Quest.knight_9.step2":"Take it easy, there is still chance that you and him are going to be best of friends.","Quest.knight_9.step3":"Don't worry, Gingerbeard, we have so much history. I'll never forget about you!","Quest.woodgenerator_1.step1":"Remember you told me that your saw is the fastest one in the kingdom?","Quest.woodgenerator_1.step2":"Of course, I meant every word.","Quest.woodgenerator_1.step3":"I will believe you when I see you taking care of this giant ent and then move on to the next one. Even bigger one...","Quest.woodgenerator_1.step4":"Challenge accepted!","Quest.woodgenerator_2.step1":"Satisfied now?","Quest.woodgenerator_2.step2":"You know what they say. Once – coincidence. Twice – evidence.","Quest.woodgenerator_2.step3":"I see what you did there. Let's take on this next ent together as a team! ","Quest.woodgenerator_2.step4":"I thought you would never ask!","Quest.fruitshop_0.step1":"Are you prepared to be blown away?","Quest.fruitshop_0.step2":"What is it? You've found something to eat? For the millionth time.","Quest.fruitshop_0.step3":"Better! I don't have to look for food no more. Maybe there is something there for you too.","Quest.resourceshop_0.step1":"I need a little help. Do you mind?","Quest.resourceshop_0.step2":"You never ask for help. It seems suspicious. And is probably very tiring.","Quest.resourceshop_0.step3":"Yes indeed it is. But the more hands we have, the faster we can rebuild the Kingdom using supplies from this store.","Quest.discountshop_0.step1":"What's this place?","Quest.discountshop_0.step2":"They've got everything we might need for restoring our Kingdom. I personally know the owner. He is a great wizard.","Quest.discountshop_0.step3":"I know nothing about magic but restoring the Kingdom sounds just like what we're trying to do.","Quest.kraken_0.step1":"I didn't know that there were giant squids in our waters.","Quest.kraken_0.step2":"I bet you also didn't know that we can use the keys to fight evil spirits. Let me show you how it's done!","Quest.hunter_1.step1":"Do you know what you’re lacking? Perspective. How about some bird’s eye view?","Quest.hunter_1.step2":"Are you okay? I think I’ve told you to stop eating everything you see.","Quest.hunter_1.step3":"It’s not about what I’ve eaten. It’s about what I’ve found. Let’s look for more!","Quest.hunter_2.step1":"How is it going, lads?","Quest.hunter_2.step2":"Spectacular, your highness. If everything goes according to the plan, our team will have a new recruit in no time.","Quest.hunter_2.step3":"Glad to hear that. Keep up the good work and let me know if you need any help.","Quest.hunter_3.step1":"Hey, Grizzly, how will you feel when you're not the only beast around anymore?","Quest.hunter_3.step2":"You know me. I am very animal friendly. So animal friendly, in fact, that I’ll help you find the rest!","Quest.hunter_4.step1":"Do you think we need someone else’s help?","Quest.hunter_4.step2":"We’ve got a big enough squad to do it on our own.","Quest.hunter_4.step3":"Well, in that case, I am sorry. I think I’ve accidentally invited Mergelot to join us.","Quest.hunter_5.step1":"I’ve heard that you’re looking for a new hero?","Quest.hunter_5.step2":"Yes. We don’t know who it might be but we dying to know.","Quest.hunter_5.step3":"Why do you need a new hero anyway? You’ve got me now.","Quest.hunter_5.step4":"The more great teammates we have, the faster we can rebuild the kingdom.","Quest.hunter_6.step1":"Why did you decide to help us? I thought you preferred to work alone.","Quest.hunter_6.step2":"I do. But you know perfectly well where it got me. If it weren’t for you, I would forever remain in oblivion.","Quest.hunter_6.step3":"Yeah, I guess, we did save you. Does it make you forever in our debt?","Quest.hunter_6.step4":"I’m not sure about eternity but you can ask me for anything you want and I will do it.","Quest.hunter_7.step1":"Do you remember our conversation about you being so grateful that you would do anything for me?","Quest.hunter_7.step2":"Yes, of course. Do you have something in mind?","Quest.hunter_7.step3":"There is a girl I kind of like and I would appreciate it if you could give me a chance to win her over.","Quest.hunter_7.step4":"No need to worry, my friend. There is nothing I enjoy more than being a bachelor. If anything, I can give you advice on how to make her fall in love with you.","Quest.hunter_7.step5":"That would be better than the most lavish dinner I could ever imagine! Let’s do this right after finding ourselves a new hero.","Quest.hunter_8.step1":"Are you excited to meet another hero?","Quest.hunter_8.step2":"As long as she brings something new to the table.","Quest.hunter_8.step3":"You and your food innuendos... Let’s get to work!","Quest.snow_1.step1":"Since our team is getting bigger we’ve decided to build another castle. Would you like to help us?","Quest.snow_1.step2":"Every construction crew needs a supervisor. Thank you for the offer, I’ll gladly accept it!","Quest.snow_2.step1":"How everything is going?","Quest.snow_2.step2":"It might’ve been better if you were actually helping us instead of just sitting there…","Quest.snow_2.step3":"I’m sorry but I can’t work when I’m hungry.","Quest.snow_2.step4":"But you’re hungry all the time.","Quest.snow_2.step5":"Exactly!","Quest.snow_3.step1":"Are you building an ice castle? I’ve always wondered what it would be like to live in one.","Quest.snow_3.step2":"Yes but it’s taking us too long because…","Quest.snow_3.step3":"Because we don’t have enough materials! Come on, guys, let’s go and get some more.","Quest.snow_4.step1":"What was it all about?","Quest.snow_4.step2":"You know how things with me and Emeralda are complicated. I’ll do anything to make them better.","Quest.snow_4.step3":"Even work on an empty stomach?","Quest.snow_4.step4":"I told you that she is special.","Quest.snow_5.step1":"So, what do I say to win Emeralda over?","Quest.snow_5.step2":"I just used to come galloping to the lady of my heart at the time and ask her if she needs a ride.","Quest.snow_5.step3":"But you’re a knight on a horse with a dragon steel sword. I’m a ranger on a hog with two horns.   ","Quest.snow_5.step4":"I guess I didn’t think it through… Don’t worry! We’ll come up with something.","Quest.snow_6.step1":"Do you remember me being from a long line of chemists?","Quest.snow_6.step2":"Of course, how could we forget? You wouldn’t let us.","Quest.snow_6.step3":"Well, it has finally paid off since I’ve found a way to make the ice solid even when exposed to heat.  ","Quest.snow_6.step4":"Great news! We’ll gladly find you more ice to experiment with.","Quest.snow_7.step1":"Don’t you feel cold?","Quest.snow_7.step2":"No, why do you ask?","Quest.snow_7.step3":"I guess it’s kind of freezing here.","Quest.snow_7.step4":"I just never stop working to keep my body warm. You should try it some time.","Quest.snow_8.step1":"I must say, Grizzly, your achievements as a chemist are astonishing.","Quest.snow_8.step2":"I appreciate it, your highness. I still need a couple more samples to perfect the formula, though.","Quest.snow_8.step3":"Say no more. We’re already on it!","Quest.snow_9.step1":"Do you have a favorite building? Since you were the one who erected all of them.","Quest.snow_9.step2":"It’s like having to pick your favorite child. Every each one of them is perfect in its own way.","Quest.snow_11.step1":"Congratulations are in order! The formula is stable and ready to use.","Quest.snow_11.step2":"Great job, Grizzly. I’m very proud of you and our team. With the citizens like this the Kingdom will be even stronger than before.","Quest.crystal_1.step1":"My prayers have been heard. Finally something to drink with my meals!","Quest.crystal_1.step2":"Don’t you dare drinking it, you fool. Don’t you know what it is?","Quest.crystal_1.step3":"You know me. I like to act because I don’t like to think.","Quest.crystal_1.step4":"Pack your things. We’re going on an adventure. Make sure to bring more of that liquid stuff with you.","Quest.crystal_2.step1":"Where are we going?","Quest.crystal_2.step2":"We’re a looking for a magic scroll.","Quest.crystal_2.step3":"Why? You know I can’t read.","Quest.crystal_2.step4":"You don’t need to read anything. Just keep looking for those bottles.","Quest.crystal_3.step1":"Are you going to help me find this magic bottle?","Quest.crystal_3.step2":"I will attend you on your quest. Not to help though, but to make sure that you don’t try and taste their contents.","Quest.crystal_use.step1":"Great work, Hog Rider. Are you ready for some wisdom to be dropped?","Quest.crystal_use.step2":"Yes, enlighten me.","Quest.crystal_use.step3":"The ancient inscription says that you can merge this liquid rainbow potion with any object.","Quest.crystal_use.step4":"I can put this bottle next to anything and it will work as if all of the objects were of the same kind?","Quest.crystal_use.step5":"Exactly. That’s a little thing I like to call Mergest Kingdom magic.","Quest.lava_1.step1":"Ouch! This stone is quite hot, I almost got toasted!","Quest.lava_1.step2":"You bet. It's better not to touch it with bare hands. It's a lava stone!","Quest.lava_1.step3":"Just what we needed!","Quest.lava_2.step1":"Do you think you can build a house out of lava?","Quest.lava_2.step2":"I don't know, let's put these stones together and see what happens.","Quest.lava_2.step3":"Great plan! ","Quest.lava_3.step1":"Does it look like a building yet?","Quest.lava_3.step2":"Not at all. This could be anything but a building.","Quest.lava_3.step3":"We desperately need a proper tool. Grizzly, help us! You know your way around hot metal so you'll have no problem dealing with lava.","Quest.lava_3.step4":"Actually, I was planning on taking a little break...","Quest.lava_4.step1":"Looks like Grizzly has built himself a den...","Quest.lava_4.step2":"I think it's a huge fire turtle!","Quest.lava_4.step3":"Turtle? With a door instead of the head? We're definitely heading in the wrong direction...","Quest.lava_4.step4":"Let's grab a bite and try to make something more elegant out of it! ","Quest.lava_5.step1":"Is this your idea of elegance?","Quest.lava_5.step2":"Well, at least it looks like a house, not a turtle.","Quest.lava_5.step3":"How is it going, lads?","Quest.lava_5.step4":"We want to build a house using these lava stones, but what we have so far is hardly tasteful...","Quest.lava_5.step5":"Have you tried cooling the stones with cold water?","Quest.lava_5.step6":"Um... Can you do that?","Quest.lava_6.step1":"Why didn't we think about cooling the stones in the first place?! Look how gorgeous it is!","Quest.lava_6.step2":"Let's not stop there, I have an idea!","Quest.lava_6.step3":"I'm all ears.","Quest.lava_6.step4":"Don't interrupt my train of thought. You'll see for yourself soon. ","Quest.lava_7.step1":"You did a great job!","Quest.lava_7.step2":"I think this is one of my best works! Considering the material...","Quest.lava_7.step3":"How about another room with large windows?","Quest.lava_7.step4":"Sure, we deserve to have a great view of our Kingdom!","Quest.lava_8.step1":"All done! How do you like the view?","Quest.lava_8.step2":"What a cute pantry. Or is that the room with large windows I was talking to you about earlier?","Quest.lava_8.step3":"I think you hurt his feelings. Why so cruel?","Quest.lava_8.step4":"Everything is going according to plan. I know what he is capable of, but he needs the right push.","Quest.lava_8.step5":"I wish they taught that at the sorcery university.","Quest.lava_9.step1":"Fangtooth is here to help.","Quest.lava_9.step2":"Help is always good even though I'm almost done here.","Quest.lava_9.step3":"Very strong. How?","Quest.lava_9.step4":"I want to build a castle that no one in the Kingdom has ever seen before!","Quest.lava_9.step5":"Fangtooth never seen a castle.","Quest.lava_9.step6":"In that case, help me and you will be the first one to see this masterpiece! ","Quest.lava_11.step1":"Didn't you change your mind about helping me?","Quest.lava_11.step2":"Fangtooth doesn't know how to change mind.","Quest.lava_11.step3":"You have a lot to learn. I hope it doesn't apply to erecting buildings. ","Quest.centaur_1.step1":"Do you mind taking a look at this test tube?","Quest.centaur_1.step2":"I need to know in advance what is it that you want to find out.","Quest.centaur_1.step3":"Any information is of value to us.","Quest.centaur_1.step4":"In that case, I need more objects to work with.","Quest.centaur_2.step1":"I beg you, be careful with that. All the items should be intact for the Enchantress to study. The King himself asked for that.","Quest.centaur_2.step2":"Don’t worry, I’m always careful. And even if it breaks, can’t she cast a restoration spell on it or something?","Quest.centaur_2.step3":"I don’t think that she would want to waste her magic on something as minor. So let’s just be extra cautious.","Quest.centaur_3.step1":"I’ve probably asked you this question a million times already. Why are we collecting all these utensils?","Quest.centaur_3.step2":"I would usually have an answer for you but this time it’s coming from the above. If you really want to know, it worth trying your luck with the King himself.","Quest.centaur_3.step3":"Alright, but first we need to find something else so I don’t embark on this mission empty-handed.","Quest.centaur_4.step1":"You wanted to speak with me?","Quest.centaur_4.step2":"Yes, sire. Why it’s so important for us to collect and study these peculiar objects?","Quest.centaur_4.step3":"I’m glad that it got your interest. I tell you what. Come back with a new item and I’ll reveal the plan to you.","Quest.centaur_5.step1":"Well done! Are you ready to hear the secret behind these objects?","Quest.centaur_5.step2":"Sure thing. My curiosity kept me looking even when I was extremely hungry.","Quest.centaur_5.step3":"Many years ago we had a royal orphanage for special kids. But the building was destroyed during the battle. I have a feeling that these utensils may belong to one of its former residents.","Quest.centaur_5.step4":"Thank you for sharing this with me, sire. I will not rest until we find their owner.","Quest.centaur_6.step1":"What happened to you?","Quest.centaur_6.step2":"Nothing. Why do you ask?","Quest.centaur_6.step3":"You work with such ferocity. I’ve never seen you like that before.","Quest.centaur_6.step4":"Let’s not waste time talking. We need to find the rest of the objects.","Quest.centaur_7.step1":"Excuse me, sire. I feel kind of bad keeping this information a secret from the team. Can I, please, tell them about the orphanage?","Quest.centaur_7.step2":"You’re probably right. It’s better to let everyone know what we’re fighting for.","Quest.centaur_8.step1":"So that’s what it’s all about. It explains a lot and it’s good to know that we’re all on the same page now.","Quest.centaur_8.step2":"Sorry for keeping you in the dark. I guess the king was just too worried about the mission so he didn’t want to jinx it.","Quest.gnomes_1.step1":"I think we might be in trouble…","Quest.gnomes_1.step2":"What is it?","Quest.gnomes_1.step3":"I just found this bomb.","Quest.gnomes_1.step4":"Let’s try to be careful with it until we find out where it came from.","Quest.gnomes_2.step1":"Phew, we are safe now.","Quest.gnomes_2.step2":"What makes you think that?","Quest.gnomes_2.step3":"No more bombs, just harmless goggles.","Quest.gnomes_2.step4":"These are supposed to protect your eyes when the bomb blows off, silly. Let’s keep looking.","Quest.gnomes_3.step1":"How about now? How can this helmet possibly be related to the bomb?","Quest.gnomes_3.step2":"It should protect your head from debris randomly flying around after the explosion.","Quest.gnomes_3.step3":"Okay, you have a point. Let’s keep looking.","Quest.gnomes_4.step1":"Things just got way more serious. We can’t keep it a secret anymore. Whom should we tell about our findings?","Quest.gnomes_4.step2":"There is only one member of our team who is able to fully appreciate the magnitude of the situation. Let’s hear what he has to say!","Quest.gnomes_5.step1":"Hey, Grizzly! I bet you’re longing for a real challenge. We’ve got something for you.","Quest.gnomes_5.step2":"If it’s again related to moving heavy objects around I think I will pass.","Quest.gnomes_5.step3":"It’s more about blowing up heavy objects so you don’t have to move them around. Are you in?","Quest.gnomes_6.step1":"Where did you find this stuff, guys? It’s a pretty dangerous substance. You were right to come to me.","Quest.gnomes_6.step2":"It was lying all over the Kingdom. Do you think someone mined us?","Quest.gnomes_6.step3":"Looks more like someone very sloppy was casually carrying some dynamite around when it fell out of pocket.","Quest.gnomes_7.step1":"Look, Grizzly, you were right. We found our suspect.","Quest.gnomes_7.step2":"Let’s follow him and see where he gets us.","Quest.gnomes_8.step1":"There’re two of them! Come on, guys, it’s our cue. Let’s catch them.","Quest.gnomes_8.step2":"It’s too early. I’m pretty sure they’re up to something. We need to wait and see if it’s something good or bad.","Quest.gnomes_9.step1":"How much longer should we wait? They are getting more and more explosives.","Quest.gnomes_9.step2":"I always knew that you’re impatient but I thought it was only related to food.","Quest.gnomes_9.step3":"If they blow out the canteen there will be no food to worry about!","Quest.sand_1.step1":"You know how I’m spending all of my free time in the laboratory?","Quest.sand_1.step2":"Yes, I do more than anyone. Because things are heavier without you.","Quest.sand_1.step3":"Well, I was able to discover the deposit of sand. It’s full of bricks like this. We can use them to build something. And the best part is… I’ll help you carry!","Quest.sand_1.step4":"Now we’re talking! Let me get Gingerbeard!","Quest.sand_2.step1":"What was so important that you had to wake me up? I was having a most wonderful dream where I had two saws…","Quest.sand_2.step2":"You should thank me, then. I’m giving you an opportunity to use the one you actually have. But first, we need to collect the materials.","Quest.sand_3.step1":"It already looks good, don’t you think?","Quest.sand_3.step2":"These are just a few blocks put together…","Quest.sand_3.step3":"Yes, but it’s the first step to something great.","Quest.sand_3.step4":"Technically, it’s a third step but whatever. I’m curious to know when did you manage to become so patient?","Quest.sand_4.step1":"If we build more huts like this, imagine how much food you’ll be able to store…","Quest.sand_4.step2":"I’m not that interested in sustenance anymore. After all, it’s just an ephemeral pleasure.","Quest.sand_4.step3":"I don’t know what scares me more, the fact that you’re saying no to food or that you know the word \"ephemeral\".","Quest.sand_5.step1":"What is it with you not wanting to eat anything that comes into your view? ","Quest.sand_5.step2":"Okay, I’ll tell you, but first, we need to build more of these stalls.","Quest.sand_6.step1":"Alright, we are ready to hear the explanation.","Quest.sand_6.step2":"Sure, but first, we need to build more--","Quest.sand_6.step3":"Nice try, buddy. It won’t work this time. Tell us!","Quest.sand_6.step4":"I decided to lose weight.","Quest.sand_7.step1":"Is everything okay? Why would you do that?","Quest.sand_7.step2":"Yeah, why? Did Emeralda agree to go out on a date with you and you’re just worried that you will go broke paying for your standard 17 courses? If that’s the case, I can lend you some gold…","Quest.sand_7.step3":"Thank you, Gingerbeard. I appreciate it. But let’s focus on doing our job. Those cottages won’t build themselves.","Quest.sand_8.step1":"I think I’m going to speak for everyone here. I refuse to erect any more manors until you spill all the beans.","Quest.sand_8.step2":"Okay, here we go… You were right when you said I’m not doing it for myself…","Quest.sand_8.step3":"I knew that it had something to do with Emeralda! Who is a genius now, Grizzly?","Quest.sand_8.step4":"I’m doing it for my hog.","Quest.sand_9.step1":"So, you’re depriving yourself of the pleasure of food for your hog’s sake?","Quest.sand_9.step2":"He is not getting any younger, you know. And I’m getting heavier. I don’t want him to suffer anymore.","Quest.sand_9.step3":"Actually, there might be another solution for that. You go and finish building more mansions, and I will check something.","Quest.sand_11.step1":"Burn a lot of calories while building a giant pyramid… Is that really your solution?","Quest.sand_11.step2":"No, it’s just something for you to do while I’m working on the magic elixir. It will be your reward for a job well done.","Quest.asia_1.step1":"Where did you find this? And why? We have enough buildings made of stone. You made them, remember?","Quest.asia_1.step2":"How could I forget… But this is not an ordinary stone. Help me find more of this and I’ll tell you more.","Quest.asia_1.step3":"Not again… Why does this always work on me? Let’s keep looking!","Quest.asia_2.step1":"Here is a bunch of stones for you. Can I know more about them now? Please!","Quest.asia_2.step2":"Okay-okay. You did a good job. You deserve to know that it’s not stone, it’s terracotta.","Quest.asia_2.step3":"Terra-what?","Quest.asia_3.step1":"Now we have enough resources to erect the terracotta castle. We start from the foundation and build our way up.","Quest.asia_3.step2":"How do you come up with this stuff? First some terracotta, now terracotta castle…","Quest.asia_3.step3":"I don’t know what rock you live under but everyone in the kingdom knows this legend.","Quest.asia_3.step4":"Yeah? I bet I can find someone else on our team who has never heard about it before!","Quest.asia_4.step1":"Hey, Fangtooth! Do you know what this is?","Quest.asia_4.step2":"It’s a terracotta frame.","Quest.asia_4.step3":"Damn it, Fangtooth. You were my only hope.","Quest.asia_5.step1":"Any luck finding the uninformed?","Quest.asia_5.step2":"No… You were right. I’m the most ignorant member of our team.","Quest.asia_5.step3":"Don’t be so harsh on yourself. Help me build more of these huts so we could later turn them into something greater.","Quest.asia_5.step4":"Like the castle? Okay, I’m in!","Quest.asia_6.step1":"So, what’s the deal with the terracotta?","Quest.asia_6.step2":"There was a great emperor on one of the islands in the Seventh Realm. He was very powerful but vain. So he decided to build the biggest castle for himself.","Quest.asia_6.step3":"What happened next?","Quest.asia_6.step4":"Next, he helped me build more of these tiny houses…","Quest.asia_7.step1":"I’m serious, what happened to the king?","Quest.asia_7.step2":"He became paranoid. He locked himself in the castle and alienated all of his people. He was left there alone. Until he was turned into a terracotta statue sitting on his throne.","Quest.asia_7.step3":"Does this look anything like his castle?","Quest.asia_7.step4":"No, but we’re getting there.","Quest.asia_8.step1":"I’m sorry. But why are we trying to rebuild this castle? I don’t want to turn into a statue.","Quest.asia_8.step2":"The legend says that if the castle is rebuilt to serve people its doors will be always open for ones who seek shelter. So we’re kind of doing a good thing here.","Quest.asia_9.step1":"This already looks like a castle, if you ask me.","Quest.asia_9.step2":"Yes, it’s beautiful and big, but the castle is even larger and prettier. So let’s keep looking!","Quest.asia_11.step1":"Okay, now it has to be the castle. The third time's the charm!","Quest.asia_11.step2":"Technically, it’s what’s left of the castle. But sure, you’re right.","Quest.asia_11.step3":"That’s great news because I can’t wait to start rebuilding it!","Quest.shark_1.step1":"Did you lose your fang, Fangtooth?","Quest.shark_1.step2":"Fangtooth don’t lose.","Quest.shark_1.step3":"Whose is it, then?","Quest.shark_1.step4":"Fangtooth smell, Fangtooth find.","Quest.shark_2.step1":"Hey, Grizzly! Fangtooth picked up a scent that led us to this compass. You’re an expert of all water-related things so, naturally, we came to you looking for help.","Quest.shark_2.step2":"I will definitely need more than just a compass to conduct my research. Let’s see what else we can find!","Quest.shark_3.step1":"I hope this spotting scope will help you see things clearer.","Quest.shark_3.step2":"Yes, thank you. Let me take a closer look at these corals and study their origin while you keep searching for more.","Quest.shark_4.step1":"Things begin to look pretty dangerous…","Quest.shark_4.step2":"This musket is not loaded but I agree. It’s time to reach out to someone who has an eye for trouble.","Quest.shark_5.step1":"Are you setting us free?","Quest.shark_5.step2":"Not exactly. We’re giving you a chance to become a part of the team.","Quest.shark_5.step3":"Help us find and neutralize the owner of these disturbing objects and we might consider your candidacy for recruitment.","Quest.shark_6.step1":"Before we begin, let me share some findings. These are no ordinary corals. They cover any object placed on with a layer of armor making it impenetrable to water.","Quest.shark_6.step2":"Sounds like a very advanced technology… Or even some witchery!","Quest.shark_6.step3":"Whatever this is, we must find and stop its owner before it’s too late.","Quest.shark_7.step1":"We found this flag and it can only mean one thing.","Quest.shark_7.step2":"We are dealing with a member of the pirate guild. And there is only one way to find him.","Quest.shark_7.step3":"What is it?","Quest.shark_7.step4":"Bait and diversion.","Quest.shark_8.step1":"So, what’s your plan?","Quest.shark_8.step2":"We need to find something valuable and place it into the local waters while securing the perimeter.","Quest.shark_8.step3":"This should lure him into our trap and get himself caught.","Quest.shark_8.step4":"Alright, sounds solid. But whatever happens, no explosives!","Quest.shark_9.step1":"This seems valuable enough to attract our pirate.","Quest.shark_9.step2":"We will use it as a centerpiece of our master plan.","Quest.shark_9.step3":"Very well then. It’s time to go fishing!","Quest.warcraft_1.step1":"Hey, Fangtooth, did you lose anything?","Quest.warcraft_1.step2":"Fangtooth doesn’t lose.","Quest.warcraft_1.step3":"Well, in that case, help us find more of these tusks.","Quest.warcraft_2.step1":"I had no idea that tusk deposits exist.","Quest.warcraft_2.step2":"There are many things you have no idea about.","Quest.warcraft_2.step3":"Yeah, like what?","Quest.warcraft_2.step4":"For your information, tusks serve as a protection to any structure they are used to build. Here, let me demonstrate!","Quest.warcraft_3.step1":"Before we start any construction with the tusks, we need to charge them with some magic.","Quest.warcraft_3.step2":"Can’t we just do the same with everything? Let’s make our wood magical too.","Quest.warcraft_3.step3":"Only the tusks have the capacity to do that. Let me get my spellbook and we can begin.","Quest.warcraft_4.step1":"So, even a simple tusk tent like this can be as durable as a stone fortress?","Quest.warcraft_4.step2":"As a matter of fact, yes. It can be and it is. And speaking of fortresses, nothing compares to a tusk fort.","Quest.warcraft_4.step3":"And this is our end goal. To erect the most durable structure the realm has ever seen.","Quest.warcraft_5.step1":"No offense, but if we want to take on such an ambitious project mere magic won’t do. We also need expertise.","Quest.warcraft_5.step2":"What are you suggesting?","Quest.warcraft_5.step3":"Let’s summon Grizzly from his hibernation to make sure that the building itself is worth casting your spells on.","Quest.warcraft_6.step1":"So, what’s all this fuss about? I was dreaming such a great dream…","Quest.warcraft_6.step2":"Yes, you were swimming in a pond of raspberry honey, we get it. But we have something real at stake.","Quest.warcraft_6.step3":"Help us design the best fortress and Enchantress will make your dream come true.","Quest.warcraft_7.step1":"Well, guys, what do you have so far?","Quest.warcraft_7.step2":"We’ve been collecting tusks so that we have enough of them for our final project.","Quest.warcraft_7.step3":"We have a lot of work ahead of us but this is what we do best. Let’s turn it into the strongest hold the world has ever seen!","Quest.warcraft_8.step1":"We have a tiny little hiccup a size of a mammoth here…","Quest.warcraft_8.step2":"What is it?","Quest.warcraft_8.step3":"I think we are running out of tusks and I am not sure that there are enough left on the island.","Quest.warcraft_8.step4":"Don’t worry just yet. I think I might know the way out.","Quest.warcraft_9.step1":"The legend says that you can smuggle anything from anywhere. Do you think you can live up to it?","Quest.warcraft_9.step2":"This is what I do. The question is, what’s in it for me?","Quest.warcraft_9.step3":"Nothing too fancy. Just your own fleet and a chance to sail under the most respected flag in the realm.","Quest.warcraft_10.step1":"Consider the problem with the tusk supply resolved. Can you still deliver on your end?","Quest.warcraft_10.step2":"Absolutely, your highness. As promised, the most impenetrable fortress is on its way.","Quest.warcraft_12.step1":"I thought you said that there is nothing more durable than tusks…","Quest.warcraft_12.step2":"And I stand by it.","Quest.warcraft_12.step3":"How do you explain this then?","Quest.warcraft_12.step4":"Let this serve as a reminder to us that a tusk fort construction is an unforgiving process.","Quest.fish_1.step1":"I stumbled upon this intricate mechanical key in the castle's old storage room. Quite fascinating, isn't it?","Quest.fish_1.step2":"Aye, it reminds me of something from my past. Let's keep an eye out for more clues.","Quest.fish_2.step1":"Another fascinating discovery coming our way. Any thoughts on this mysterious clockwork?","Quest.fish_2.step2":"This clockwork looks familiar. It might be related to my old companion, Cyber Fin. We should investigate further.","Quest.fish_3.step1":"Who is Cyber Fin and could these goggles be hers?","Quest.fish_3.step2":"No doubt about it, they're hers. They allowed her to see clearly in the darkest depths. She once saved me from a giant fish I didn't even see coming. I owe it to Cyber Fin to find the rest of her belongings and uncover the truth.","Quest.fish_3.step3":"Since you're a part of our team now, we'll help you on that journey. Come on, let's continue our search!","Quest.fish_4.step1":"Check out this high-tech water gun! It looks like it could pack a powerful punch.","Quest.fish_4.step2":"Aye, that's Cyber Fin's weapon of choice. She could knock down enemies with the force of a tidal wave using that thing. We're definitely on the right track. Let's keep moving forward!","Quest.fish_5.step1":"Fascinating! This gauntlet seems to harness the power of water. I've never seen anything quite like it.","Quest.fish_5.step2":"That's Cyber Fin's Aqua Gauntlet. With it, she could control water like a puppeteer.","Quest.fish_5.step3":"Let's hope she doesn't use it against us!","Quest.fish_6.step1":"Look what I found! Some peculiar binoculars with a unique design.","Quest.fish_6.step2":"Aye, those be Cyber Fin's trusty binoculars. They helped her spot danger and treasures from great distances. It's a sign, me hearties! We're on the right track.","Quest.fish_6.step3":"Will she make us rich when we find her?","Quest.fish_6.step4":"Either that or we will find ourselves very wet and very poor.","Quest.fish_7.step1":"I came across this toolbag filled with all sorts of gadgets and gizmos. Think it's got anything to do with Cyber Fin?","Quest.fish_7.step2":"Arr, that be her Toolbag of Tricks! She used those gadgets to navigate, repair, and sometimes escape sticky situations. Finding it means we're closin' in, me mateys.","Quest.fish_7.step3":"Let's keep up the pace and see where these discoveries lead us!","Quest.fish_8.step1":"I discovered this highly advanced measuring device. It seems to be capable of analyzing various environmental conditions.","Quest.fish_8.step2":"Aye, that be Cyber Fin's anything-meter. She used it to collect data on the ocean's depths, currents, and even the weather above. We must be gettin' close, me hearties.","Quest.fish_8.step3":"So, all these items are leading us to Cyber Fin. Let's press on and see what awaits us at the end of this trail.","Quest.fish_9.step1":"I came across this unusual helmet. It appears to be designed for underwater exploration.","Quest.fish_9.step2":"Arr, that be the helmet Cyber Fin provided for her human allies! It allowed them to breathe underwater and communicate with her, creating a seamless partnership during missions.","Quest.fish_9.step3":"Our search is almost complete. Let's find the last item and uncover the truth about Cyber Fin.","Quest.steampunk_1.step1":"Look at this strange relic, Grizzly. Found it buried deep in our kingdom's woods. It feels almost... otherworldly.Intriguing... Its form is foreign, yet familiar. The combination of arcane symbols and mechanical components suggest it's not just a simple piece of equipment. This, my liege, is a part of something much greater. I believe this is a piece of the legendary Star Chariot!","Quest.steampunk_1.step2":"The Star Chariot, you say? That old legend about our ancestors trying to build a ship to sail across the stars? I thought it was just a fairy tale.","Quest.steampunk_1.step3":"Most legends hold a grain of truth, Gingerbeard. This discovery may just be the beginning of a grand quest. We'll need everyone's help to gather the remaining parts scattered throughout the kingdom. Let the celestial journey begin!","Quest.steampunk_2.step1":"Look what I've dug up while on the hunt for my lunch. It's small, round, and metallic. Could it be another piece of the Star Chariot?","Quest.steampunk_2.step2":"Indeed, Hog Rider. I believe it's the celestial pod. Legend says it's a part of the Star Chariot, used for shorter voyages across the celestial expanse.","Quest.steampunk_2.step3":"Imagine what it'd be like to ride across the stars in this pod. There's so much more to explore beyond our kingdom.","Quest.steampunk_2.step4":"Yes, our ancestors were far more adventurous than we thought. Let's continue our search.","Quest.steampunk_3.step1":"Look at this, a medium pod, larger and more intricate. It could be the main body of the celestial chariot.","Quest.steampunk_3.step2":"Aye, Grizzly, seems like we're on the right path! This looks fit for a long journey, perhaps even through the stars.","Quest.steampunk_3.step3":"You're on the right track. But remember, the celestial chariot isn't something to be taken lightly. Or so I've heard.","Quest.steampunk_3.step4":"Wait, CyberFin, what do you know about the celestial chariot?","Quest.steampunk_3.step5":"That's a story for another time. Let's focus on the task at hand.","Quest.steampunk_4.step1":"This, my friends, is a large pod. The celestial chariot is nearing completion.","Quest.steampunk_4.step2":"Such a grand structure. It's clear this chariot was designed to carry the hopes and dreams of its riders.","Quest.steampunk_4.step3":"If what CyberFin said is true, then this isn't just a chariot. It's our ticket to the stars.","Quest.steampunk_4.step4":"Big... Shiny... What it do?","Quest.steampunk_4.step5":"Only time will tell, Sabretooth. Only time will tell...","Quest.steampunk_5.step1":"Oh my, look at this! A small station, certainly part of our celestial chariot.","Quest.steampunk_5.step2":"It seems to be designed to exist separate from the main chariot. Fascinating...","Quest.steampunk_5.step3":"Indeed. This must be a piece of the puzzle. Keep looking, team. Every item brings us closer to our goal.","Quest.steampunk_5.step4":"Then, let's not waste time. The stars are waiting!","Quest.steampunk_5.step5":"Sabretooth not understand... But Sabretooth help!","Quest.steampunk_6.step1":"This larger station is impressive. It's clear that this object was crafted with extraordinary skill and knowledge.","Quest.steampunk_6.step2":"And it bears the same markings. I believe we are indeed assembling a celestial chariot.","Quest.steampunk_6.step3":"You're catching on. Still think you can handle what comes next?","Quest.steampunk_6.step4":"If it's a challenge, we'll face it! Bring it on, CyberFin.","Quest.steampunk_6.step5":"Good. Because there's more to find, and not a moment to lose.","Quest.steampunk_7.step1":"Whoa! This station, it's... it's about to fly off! That's some next-level wizardry right there.","Quest.steampunk_7.step2":"It's not wizardry, it's celestial engineering. This could truly be a contraption from the legends.","Quest.steampunk_7.step3":"I see I'm not the only one with a grasp on advanced technology. We're closer to the truth, but not there yet. Keep going.","Quest.steampunk_8.step1":"Look at this! It’s more than a station. It's a vessel, designed to travel...beyond.","Quest.steampunk_8.step2":"Could it be...meant for the stars?","Quest.steampunk_8.step3":"Why stop at stars? It's starbound, after all. Designed to explore the unknown, to seek out new territories.","Quest.steampunk_8.step4":"This is exciting and terrifying at the same time. We're not just dealing with the earthly here, but the celestial.","Quest.steampunk_8.step5":"Indeed, Alvin. My creator spoke of such artifacts. Tools of an ancient civilization, capable of traversing the stars. Seems like we've stumbled upon their legacy.","Quest.steampunk_9.step1":"We're moving up in the world, quite literally! This isn't just a vessel anymore, it's an Orbit Ascender.","Quest.steampunk_9.step2":"Orbit Ascender? Does this mean we're going...","Quest.steampunk_9.step3":"Into space. Yes, Gingerbeard. But remember, this is just a model. The real one must be enormous.","Quest.steampunk_9.step4":"You're right, Alvin. It's built to withstand the vacuum of space and the gravitational forces of ascension. Quite an incredible piece of engineering. The ancients were not only wise, they were also incredibly advanced.","Quest.steampunk_9.step5":"It's becoming clear now. This isn't just about merging objects. This is about merging worlds, our world with the rest of the universe. I wonder what we'll discover next.","Quest.steampunk_10.step1":"Solar Sail - an eco-friendly way to traverse the cosmos.","Quest.steampunk_10.step2":"Indeed. It uses sunlight pressure to propel forward.","Quest.steampunk_10.step3":"I wonder what space food tastes like...","Quest.steampunk_10.step4":"You might soon find out, but remember, the universe holds many unknowns.","Quest.steampunk_12.step1":"Look at this! It appears to be the body of the Celestial Chariot. It's severely damaged though.","Quest.steampunk_12.step2":"Aye, it's in rough shape. But we've got parts from those smaller vessels we found earlier. Might be just the ticket to get this old bird flying again.","Quest.steampunk_12.step3":"An excellent idea, Gingerbeard. We shall bring back the glory of this ancient marvel with our hands, our sweat.","Quest.steampunk_12.step4":"A daunting task indeed. But if we succeed, it will be a testament to our resilience and the ingenuity of our ancestors.","Quest.steampunk_12.step5":"We've got this team. Let's breathe life into this celestial beast.","Quest.panda_1.step1":"Interesting... this flower isn't indigenous to our kingdom.","Quest.panda_1.step2":"Hog Rider, Gingerbeard, do you recognize it?","Quest.panda_1.step3":"Can't say I've eaten anything like it before.","Quest.panda_1.step4":"This isn't for eating. This flower is an emblem of Luna Bamboo, a wise panda from my realm. Her wisdom might help us solve the riddle of my capture.","Quest.panda_1.step5":"A wise panda, you say? Intriguing. I suppose we must find out more about this Luna Bamboo.","Quest.panda_2.step1":"Hmm, doesn't look like a regular comb. Pretty fancy, I'd say.","Quest.panda_2.step2":"Indeed, it's not just a comb. This type of ornamentation suggests it belongs to someone of high status.","Quest.panda_2.step3":"Yes, this comb is one of Luna Bamboo's personal items. She was much more than just a panda, she was a sage. Her advice and wisdom were sought by many.","Quest.panda_2.step4":"A panda sage... How fascinating. The more I learn about Luna Bamboo, the more curious I become.","Quest.panda_3.step1":"A perfume bottle? We find the most peculiar things, don't we?","Quest.panda_3.step2":"Hah! Maybe we'll finally get Grizzly Bearington to smell a bit more... pleasant.","Quest.panda_3.step3":"That's uncalled for, Hog Rider! Though, this fragrance... It's captivating, unique. Luna Bamboo's?","Quest.panda_3.step4":"Indeed, Grizzly. Luna's scent was said to be as enchanting as her wisdom. It seems her presence lingers even in her absence.","Quest.panda_4.step1":"A hand fan? Interesting! Who would need to cool off in this breezy kingdom?","Quest.panda_4.step2":"Perhaps our dear friend, Grizzly? He seems to be getting all warm and fuzzy when Luna Bamboo is mentioned!","Quest.panda_4.step3":"I'm simply intrigued by her wisdom and knowledge, nothing more!","Quest.panda_4.step4":"Indeed, Grizzly. Your flushed face surely speaks of your... academic interest in Luna.","Quest.panda_5.step1":"What a splendid piece, it's a Nephrite necklace. These were believed to enhance spiritual power and wisdom in the ancient tales.","Quest.panda_5.step2":"Indeed, Enchantress. This could have been Luna Bamboo's source of wisdom and inner strength. Nephrite is a highly valued gem in her homeland.","Quest.panda_5.step3":"This piece could tell us more about Luna than we could've ever imagined. Let's not delay, we must continue our quest.","Quest.panda_6.step1":"Look at this, a parchment! It's an ancient scroll. Can't make heads or tails of the characters, though.","Quest.panda_6.step2":"These are ancient symbols, the precursor to the language we use today. Luna must have been knowledgeable to understand these.","Quest.panda_6.step3":"I wish I could understand this as she did. It might hold vital clues. Let's keep this safe. We're getting closer to understanding Luna Bamboo's story.","Quest.panda_7.step1":"These are Geta! Luna must have a certain appreciation for traditional attire.","Quest.panda_7.step2":"She seems to have an interesting style. I must say, it's quite... unique.","Quest.panda_7.step3":"Grizzly, you're not thinking of switching your boots for these, are you?","Quest.panda_7.step4":"What? No, I... Ah, let's just move on.","Quest.panda_8.step1":"Wow, look at this hat. Luna must have worn this often. It's beautifully worn in.","Quest.panda_8.step2":"You've taken quite an interest in Luna's belongings, haven't you, Grizzly?","Quest.panda_8.step3":"Just trying to understand her better. For the sake of our mission, of course.","Quest.panda_8.step4":"Of course, for the sake of the mission. What else could it be?","Quest.panda_9.step1":"Look at this. An ancient cane, adorned with symbols and intricate carvings. This must have been Luna's.","Quest.panda_9.step2":"There's a magic aura emanating from this cane. Luna wasn't just an ordinary leader, but a sorceress as well.","Quest.panda_9.step3":"Indeed, Luna Bamboo was the Chief of her clan. This cane was a symbol of her authority and her connection to the ancient magic of the Panda clan.","Quest.panda_9.step4":"Magic and leadership in one cane? What if we hit someone with it, will they become magically obedient?","Quest.moonstone_1.step1":"This small pebble... there's a strange energy surrounding it. It's unlike anything we've come across before.","Quest.moonstone_1.step2":"It sure doesn't taste like any rock I've ever eaten. Maybe we're onto something new here?","Quest.moonstone_1.step3":"Indeed, Hog Rider. This pebble might just be the first piece of a bigger puzzle.","Quest.moonstone_1.step4":"We should gather more of these. Who knows what secrets they might reveal as we merge them together.","Quest.moonstone_2.step1":"Fascinating! The merged pebbles have formed a sharper, denser object. I believe we have a 'Moon Shard' on our hands.","Quest.moonstone_2.step2":"Strange. This material's composition is nothing like we have on the kingdom's grounds. It's...different.","Quest.moonstone_2.step3":"Different or not, it's still something to work with! We should keep merging, see what it turns into next.","Quest.moonstone_2.step4":"I agree, Gingerbeard. Every mystery uncovered leads us closer to greater knowledge. Keep merging, my friends!","Quest.moonstone_3.step1":"The more we merge, the more I see a similar energy to our Celestial Carriage. It's quite fascinating.","Quest.moonstone_3.step2":"Intriguing... the sphere shape, the glow. Could there be a celestial connection we've yet to fully grasp?","Quest.moonstone_3.step3":"Only one way to find out. Let's keep merging and see what secrets we uncover!","Quest.moonstone_3.step4":"Indeed, this is the essence of our quest. Unraveling the unknown.","Quest.moonstone_4.step1":"Look at this! The structure... It's a lot like a diamond, but different... It's as if it's born from moonlight.","Quest.moonstone_4.step2":"Aye, it sparkles like the night sky. This must surely have celestial significance.","Quest.moonstone_4.step3":"I concur. The resonance of this item is strikingly similar to the Celestial Carriage. There may be more to this than meets the eye.","Quest.moonstone_4.step4":"Our pursuit of knowledge continues then. Merge, merge, and merge again, until the truth is unearthed!","Quest.moonstone_5.step1":"By my beard! These things are tougher than my mother's beef stew!","Quest.moonstone_5.step2":"Strange indeed. It's like they've been... weathered by something other than the elements.","Quest.moonstone_5.step3":"I sense a different kind of magic from these formations. It's unlike anything I've come across.","Quest.moonstone_5.step4":"Well, if these rocks could talk, I bet they'd have some wild tales to tell!","Quest.moonstone_6.step1":"Ha, these formations are starting to look like some kind of plant or a tree, eh?!","Quest.moonstone_6.step2":"Curious. They do seem to have taken a more...organic shape. Maybe they're not just rocks?","Quest.moonstone_6.step3":"Fascinating observation, Emeralda. I believe this might be a sign of more complex processes at work.","Quest.moonstone_6.step4":"Complex process, easy process, I don't care. As long as it doesn't jump up and bite me, I'm good.","Quest.moonstone_7.step1":"Is it just me, or does this 'rock formation' look like a blossom of some sort?","Quest.moonstone_7.step2":"Indeed, it does appear that way. Quite fascinating... and odd. Rocks shouldn't blossom.","Quest.moonstone_7.step3":"Well, there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in your philosophy.","Quest.moonstone_7.step4":"Oy, I've got a bad feeling about this... If rocks start turning into flowers, what's next? Pigs flying?","Quest.moonstone_7.step5":"I would not mind that at all! Let's keep merging!","Quest.moonstone_8.step1":"Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle. From rocks to blossoms and now, full-blown flowers! This is getting weirder by the minute.","Quest.moonstone_8.step2":"Isn't it beautiful? It's unlike anything we've seen before.","Quest.moonstone_8.step3":"This isn't your average flower. The energy I'm picking up from it... It's extraordinary.","Quest.moonstone_8.step4":"Could this be the secret ingredient for moon pies?","Quest.moonstone_9.step1":"This Moon Stone... It has the same energy frequency as the Celestial Carriage. Could it be the key to power it up?","Quest.moonstone_9.step2":"Powering up a chariot with a stone? Now I've heard everything.","Quest.moonstone_9.step3":"Well, it does make sense, in a twisted, magical sort of way...","Quest.moonstone_9.step4":"Remember, magic is just science we don't understand yet. We may be on to something!","Quest.moonstone_10.step1":"An obelisk... Why does this remind me of the Celestial Carriage? Maybe because they both have a similar glow and energy? ","Quest.moonstone_10.step2":"Could this Obelisk be a 'fuel station' for the Carriage?","Quest.moonstone_10.step3":"Fuel station? And here I was thinking it could be a huge toothpick!","Quest.moonstone_10.step4":"While your thoughts are fascinating, let's focus. We may be a step closer to igniting our Carriage!","Quest.moonstone_11.step1":"Remarkable, a perfectly formed Cube! Its energy feels identical to the Celestial Carriage.","Quest.moonstone_11.step2":"Ha, we found it! Let's just shove it into the Carriage's engine and be done with it!","Quest.moonstone_11.step3":"Patience, Gingerbeard. The composition of this Cube doesn't exactly match the engine's keyhole. But we're on the right path...","Quest.moonstone_11.step4":"Alright, alright... On to the next giant space rock then!","Quest.moonstone_13.step1":"Hold up, team. What on earth... or should I say, what on the moon is this?","Quest.moonstone_13.step2":"Looks like a sad pile of moon rubble if you ask me. A bit like your attempts at humor, Grizzly!","Quest.moonstone_13.step3":"Aye, 'tis a wreck alright, but... it's not just a pile of rocks. It looks... deliberate.","Quest.moonstone_13.step4":"You're correct, Hog Rider. It appears to be some kind of structure, but it's in ruins.","Quest.moonstone_13.step5":"This means we're not the first ones to attempt this celestial journey. Someone or something has been here before...","Quest.moonstone_13.step6":"And they've left us a clue. Let's collect these pieces. Perhaps, we can rebuild this structure and learn its purpose."},"rapunzel_json":{"Units.rprapunzel.name":"Eleonora","Units.rprapunzel.stage1.name":"Pan","Units.rprapunzel.stage2.name":"Cupcake","Units.rprapunzel.stage3.name":"Lantern","Units.rprapunzel.stage4.name":"Flower","Units.rprapunzel.stage5.name":"Palette","Units.rprapunzel.stage6.name":"Dress","Units.rprapunzel.stage7.name":"Young

The only difference is that I don't have a handsome prince who is always ready to come to the rescue.","Quest.rpdress_3.step4":"Speaking about the prince, let’s find the rest of the garments and bring them to him.","Quest.rpchameleon_3.step1":"What a cute little creature. Did you ever dream about having a pet?","Quest.rpchameleon_3.step2":"Even if I did, it would not be a chameleon.","Quest.rpchameleon_3.step3":"Why not?","Quest.rpchameleon_3.step4":"It becomes impossible to find one when it mimics the surroundings. So once we have it, we should bring it to the prince before it disappears.","Quest.rprapunzel_1.step1":"The princess must be somewhere nearby. This pan has her initials on it.","Quest.rprapunzel_1.step2":"It’s a good sign. Let’s keep looking!","Quest.rprapunzel_2.step1":"What a wonderful cupcake! You can tell that the princess made it.","Quest.rprapunzel_2.step2":"I guess cooking is just one of her many talents. Let’s see what else we can find!","Quest.rprapunzel_3.step1":"Do you think the princess left the lanterns behind so she can find her way back home?","Quest.rprapunzel_3.step2":"Or so that we can trace her! Let’s follow the lanterns. I am sure they will shed light on other clues.","Quest.rprapunzel_4.step1":"Just look at this flower! Why is it glowing?","Quest.rprapunzel_4.step2":"I think the princess is the right person to ask this question. Let’s find her to get all the answers!","Quest.rprapunzel_5.step1":"Did you know that the princess loves to paint?","Quest.rprapunzel_5.step2":"I am not surprised. We saw her talents displayed before.","Quest.rprapunzel_5.step3":"I am starting to think that she painted this castle…","Quest.rprapunzel_5.step4":"I bet she regrets not drafting its map.","Quest.rprapunzel_6.step1":"Did you ever wonder what a princess’ dress might look like?","Quest.rprapunzel_6.step2":"I am more curious if she made it herself.","Quest.rprapunzel_6.step3":"I think we saw enough evidence of her various skills. Sewing a dress, how hard can it be?","Quest.rprapunzel_6.step4":"Let’s make more and find out!","Quest.rprapunzel_7.step1":"We know that Eleonora is somewhere in the castle and that we can only find her if we all work together.","Quest.rprapunzel_7.step2":"That is indeed the case. If we manage to remove the fog and find all the clues, make no mistake, the princess will be saved.","Quest.rprapunzel_7.step3":"Alright then. Let's proceed with collecting the ingredients and see where we can find the first clue!","Quest.rprapunzel_7_2.step1":"It seems like this castle is still full of surprises!","Quest.rprapunzel_7_2.step2":"And the young princess here is kind enough to guide us through them. Are you ready for another adventure?","Quest.rprapunzel_7_2.step3":"Sure I am! Let's split and find what else hides behind that fog!","Quest.rpcentaur_0_2.step1":"We haven't been properly introduced yet but we don't have time for pleasantries! The fate of the universe depends on you!","Quest.rpcentaur_0_2.step2":"What? Why? We're just passing by.","Quest.rpcentaur_0_2.step3":"I don't believe in accidents. You're here for a reason.","Quest.rpcentaur_0_2.step4":"Alright, alright. What should we begin with?","Quest.rptelescope_0.step1":"If my calculations are correct, and they are, there is a meteorite coming our way. I know how to set it off course, but my telescope is missing a unique lens. I need your help with that.","Quest.rptelescope_0.step2":"Sounds easy enough. Just tell us where we can get the lens.","Quest.rptelescope_0.step3":"Get the lens? You can't just get it, we need to make it using the rarest materials and my patented technology. Just go to the mine. My minions are expecting you.","Quest.rptrolley_0.step1":"Hey, guys. Your boss told us that we can collect some unique resources required to produce some unique lenses. Do you know anything about it?","Quest.rptrolley_0.step2":"Of course, we've been learning to mine it for the longest time to stop the meteorite. The thing is...","Quest.rptrolley_0.step3":"Let me guess, your partner is littered with stones? Don't feel bad, we've all been there.","Quest.rptrolley_0.step4":"Thanks. We would have to rescue him before we can rescue the world.","Quest.rptrolley_1.step1":"Thanks for saving me. I will have to check the breaks on our trolley but first let me return the favor by clearing that rubble.","Quest.rptrolley_1.step2":"It seems like time is of the essence here. So let's all work together to make things faster.","Quest.rptrolley_2.step1":"Oops, we've underestimated the damage.","Quest.rptrolley_2.step2":"What do you mean?","Quest.rptrolley_2.step3":"The trolley we use to collect the resources is broken.","Quest.rptrolley_2.step4":"Don't you worry about it. We're second to none when it comes to fixing things. It will be done lickety-split!","Quest.rptrolley_3.step1":"You weren't lying. You're good at fixing stuff. Well, let us show you how fast we can mine resources. ","Quest.rppress_1.step1":"It looks like the collapse affected the crane too. Do you have experience fixing heavy machinery?","Quest.rppress_1.step2":"Do we have experience fixing heavy machinery? Please, we can fix anything even if it's not broken.","Quest.rpcrane_1.step1":"Oh my god, Alvin will kill us! We've broken his press. Without it, we can produce lenses for the telescope.","Quest.rpcrane_1.step2":"In that case, it might be the meteorite that kills you.","Quest.rpcrane_1.step3":"Don't worry, guys. It's an easy fix. We just need to find all the spare parts and work in tandem.","Quest.rpdoorway_0.step1":"Why are all of the books piled up? Whoever did this clearly didn't understand what kind of treasure was in his possession. ","Quest.rpdoorway_0.step2":"Or maybe someone was trying to hide some other treasures they might have had. Let's clean this up and find out!","Quest.rpdoorway_1.step1":"The books keep on coming our way. Maybe it's a sign that we should read more?","Quest.rpdoorway_1.step2":"I think after we clean this mess up we will officially become the most well-read janitors in the world.","Quest.rpdoorway_2.step1":"Finally! No more books. It looks like we're done here.","Quest.rpdoorway_2.step2":"Aren't you curious to find out what hides behind this door?","Quest.rpdoorway_2.step3":"I am. But what if there are more books? I would not survive this.","Quest.rpdoorway_2.step4":"I promise you, even if we stumble on just a page, we will immediately abandon this endeavor and indulge ourselves with something less sophisticated.","Quest.rpdoorway_3.step1":"To be honest, I am scared to go inside.","Quest.rpdoorway_3.step2":"Don't be. Fortune favors the brave! ","Quest.rpprincehero_1.step1":"Have you seen the prince? I think he lost his gloves.","Quest.rpprincehero_1.step2":"He went to get a gift for the princess to celebrate her return but got lost himself...","Quest.rpprincehero_1.step3":"That's horrible! We must save him too.","Quest.rpprincehero_2.step1":"Here comes the hat. We're getting closer.","Quest.rpprincehero_2.step2":"I wouldn't get your hopes up. The castle is even bigger than we thought before... ","Quest.rpprincehero_3.step1":"He wouldn't get too far without his boots, would he?","Quest.rpprincehero_3.step2":"No, but what if he had a spare pair? As far as I am concerned, he can be anywhere so we should search every last corner.","Quest.rpprincehero_4.step1":"Oh no, the poor prince lost his saber. What if he gets in trouble in the dungeon or something even worse happens?","Quest.rpprincehero_4.step2":"In that case, we should probably try and find him as soon as possible rather than contemplating this misfortune.","Quest.rpprincehero_5.step1":"The sight of this medal calms me down.","Quest.rpprincehero_5.step2":"Why is that?","Quest.rpprincehero_5.step3":"It's evidence of the fact that the prince can stand up for himself if it comes to that.","Quest.rpprincehero_5.step4":"Still, we should hurry up to find him. Who knows what other secrets this castle might have?","Quest.rpprincehero_6.step1":"What a gorgeous doublet. I think we owe it to the prince to reunite him with it.","Quest.rpprincehero_6.step2":"I couldn't agree more. Let's hope that we are getting closer!","Quest.rapunzel2_chop.step1":"Let's provide the princess with the ingredients so she could help us reveal the castle's secrets!","Quest.rptelescope_open.step1":"And what should we do?","Quest.rptelescope_open.step2":"Let's keep looking. I have a feeling that we are going to find something very soon!"},"rapunzel_unitStories_json":{"UnitStory.rprapunzel_6.rapunzel.step1":"We finally found our princess.

He is a great wizard.","UnitStory.discountshop_0.step3":"I know nothing about magic but restoring the Kingdom sounds just like what we're trying to do.","UnitStory.lava_9.step1":"Remember how you felt cold when building the snow castle?","UnitStory.lava_9.step2":"Sure, how could I forget!","UnitStory.lava_9.step3":"Don't you feel hot now?","UnitStory.lava_9.step4":"Are you kidding? I can't stop sweating but it's too important of a task to stop going.","UnitStory.lava_11.step1":"Look who has outdone himself.","UnitStory.lava_11.step2":"Was this house built by evil spirits?","UnitStory.lava_11.step3":"What do you know about art, barbarian!","UnitStory.lava_11.step4":"Just think about it! We've got ourselves an impenetrable fortress to protect the Kingdom from all the monsters out there. What an achievement!","UnitStory.lava_11.step5":"Thank you, sire! It is indeed the most impregnable stronghold!","UnitStory.centaur_8.step1":"I think now we have everything there is to have. Is it enough to tell us something about the owner?","UnitStory.centaur_8.step2":"Let’s hope so. I’ll try my best to provide you with as much information that I could extract.","UnitStory.centaur_8.step3":"Thank you. You have no idea how important this quest is. The destiny of the Kingdom lies in your magic hands.","UnitStory.centaur_9.step1":"Alvin? Is that really you? I’m so glad to finally see you again!","UnitStory.centaur_9.step2":"I’m happy to see you too, Mr. McArthur! How did you find me? I thought I hid pretty well.","UnitStory.centaur_9.step3":"What can I say, we have the best team in the entire realm. I think we have a lot to talk about.","UnitStory.centaur_9.step4":"That is so true. I don’t even know where to start.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_0.dragonia.step1":"The tree of life! We’ve finally found it.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_0.dragonia.step2":"I didn’t even know we were looking for it.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_0.dragonia.step3":"Yes, sire, enlighten us. What is it and why do we need it?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_0.dragonia.step4":"Patience, lads. It’s all going to become clear very soon. Just be careful and keep your eyes open.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_1.dragonia.step1":"Dragons, trees, flying islands. I miss our home where you can worry about what to eat and not about being eaten.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_1.dragonia.step2":"Funny enough, I know how you feel. But if the king says that this tree is important, then it actually is. Let’s get to work.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_2.dragonia.step1":"Who are you and what do you think you’re doing?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_2.dragonia.step2":"Excuse me, we can ask you the same thing.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_2.dragonia.step3":"I’m Zafira. And you’re trespassing. ","UnitStory.drbattlepass_2.dragonia.step4":"We are not here to claim your land. We’re here only for the tree.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_2.dragonia.step5":"Of course you’re. Like so many others before you. Good luck failing!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_3.dragonia.step1":"Sire, do you know who this Zafira is and why does she act as everything here belongs to her?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_3.dragonia.step2":"I’m not aware of who she is but I understand why she doesn’t want us to succeed.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_3.dragonia.step3":"Are you going to tell us?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_3.dragonia.step4":"Of course. There is a time for everything. And now it’s time to work!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_4.dragonia.step1":"You have no idea what you’re getting yourselves into. You’re doomed even before you begin.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_4.dragonia.step2":"And you don’t know our king. He would never send us to fail. Plus, we already made some progress.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_4.dragonia.step3":"It might seem like it now, but, trust me, looks can be deceiving.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_4.dragonia.step4":"With all due respect, there is no way we can trust you. And the only way we can fail is if you keep on talking under our noses.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_5.dragonia.step1":"This girl is resilient, sire. Should we be worried?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_5.dragonia.step2":"Of course not. Soon, we’ll have nothing to worry about at all.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_5.dragonia.step3":"What do you mean?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_5.dragonia.step4":"Once the tree fully reveals itself to us and showers us with its riches our Kingdom will become the most prosperous of all.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_6.dragonia.step1":"You said that the king knows what’s he doing. But do we really need more? Not a single kingdom in the Seventh realm can match our power and resources.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_6.dragonia.step2":"I will not lie, I have my share of doubts too. And the only way to dispel them is through work for the good of the Kingdom.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_7.dragonia.step1":"It’s nice to have lieges so blinded by their own faith in their ruler so they can’t even see when he goes mad, isn't it?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_7.dragonia.step2":"Zafira, right? I’ve no idea what you’re talking about. I’m not mad and my people aren’t blind. They’re loyal.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_7.dragonia.step3":"Loyal enough to bend innocent dragons to your will?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_7.dragonia.step4":"We harm no one. And if this is what it takes to secure the future of my Kingdom, I would gladly wear such a blindfold myself.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_8.dragonia.step1":"Your king is stubborn so I trust in your good judgment. Pack your things and leave the island before it’s too late.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_8.dragonia.step2":"If it’s such a bad place what are you doing here yourself?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_8.dragonia.step3":"I keep it safe from barbarians like you.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_8.dragonia.step4":"It’s just got personal. I will not rest until this tree gives everything it has to give.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_9.dragonia.step1":"Sire, can we just dig up the tree and replant it in our Kingdom?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_9.dragonia.step2":"I’m afraid it doesn’t work like that. Everything on this island from soil to dragons nurtures the tree and keeps it alive. If treated right, it can become the source of limitless resources.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_9.dragonia.step3":"But do we really need them? We’ve been doing fine on our own without any trees of life.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_9.dragonia.step4":"Please, never question my authority ever again. I’m your king and you’ll do as I say.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_9.dragonia.step5":"Apologies, sire. Will do, sire.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_10.dragonia.step1":"I’ve never seen our king like this before. I don’t know what to think.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_10.dragonia.step2":"The power of the tree made him mindless. I’m glad you can appreciate that.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_10.dragonia.step3":"No. I’m sure there is a reason for all that.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_10.dragonia.step4":"And we will not rest until we find out what this is.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_11.dragonia.step1":"Do you think I’m being too harsh on the lads?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_11.dragonia.step2":"Desperate times call for desperate measures. The war with evil spirits shook us pretty hard. If others find out about our vulnerabilities before we deal with them, our kingdom can cease to exist…","UnitStory.drbattlepass_12.dragonia.step1":"How is it going, lads?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_12.dragonia.step2":"Everything is fine, sire. Just doing our job, serving our kingdom…","UnitStory.drbattlepass_12.dragonia.step3":"Ahem. About that. I wanted to tell you something.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_12.dragonia.step4":"We’re listening, sire.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_12.dragonia.step5":"Well… The kingdom is very lucky to have you on its side. Keep up the good work!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_13.dragonia.step1":"Still thinking that there is more to your king than pure vanity and greed?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_13.dragonia.step2":"I don’t know what to think anymore.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_13.dragonia.step3":"I think we should not be putting up with it no more.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_13.dragonia.step4":"Finally! If you ever get banished you can hang out here.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_14.dragonia.step1":"Sire, we need to talk to you!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_14.dragonia.step2":"What is it, lads?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_14.dragonia.step3":"We believe it’s unfair to make us follow this cause designed to satisfy your avarice.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_14.dragonia.step4":"I feared you might feel this way but…","UnitStory.drbattlepass_14.dragonia.step5":"We’ll do the last round of preparation for the old times' sake but consider it our resignation. We’re going to stay here, with Zafira and her dragons. ","UnitStory.drbattlepass_14.dragonia.step6":"That’s right! Because these cold-blooded creatures are more empathic than you’ll ever be!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_15.dragonia.step1":"What should we do, Grizzly?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_15.dragonia.step2":"There aren’t many options left, sire. Let’s try to finish what we’ve started. For the Kingdom.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_15.dragonia.step3":"For the Kingdom!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_16.dragonia.step1":"Why aren’t they leaving?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_16.dragonia.step2":"I’ve been asking myself the same question. Maybe there is something more to it than just greed, after all.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_16.dragonia.step3":"Or maybe the greed is just all-consuming.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_16.dragonia.step4":"Maybe… But I won’t be able to live with myself if we don’t find out the truth.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_17.dragonia.step1":"It’s harder than I thought, Grizzly. I always appreciated the input lads made but I had no idea how much of a difference they made.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_17.dragonia.step2":"I know, sire. These are the best lads. We were lucky to work and fight side by side.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_17.dragonia.step3":"Let’s not make all the work they’ve done so far go in vain!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_18.dragonia.step1":"Lads? What are you doing here? I thought you were done.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_18.dragonia.step2":"We were. But something is not right about all that. Shed the light on the truth, your majesty.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_18.dragonia.step3":"I didn’t want to tell you but the Kingdom is having some trouble even despite your invaluable contribution. The war didn’t go unnoticed.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_18.dragonia.step4":"You should’ve told us, sire! The Kingdom is our home. We will do anything to save it!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_19.dragonia.step1":"It’s so good having you back! Grizzly and I were dying out there alone.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_19.dragonia.step2":"Yes, this job is tough and you’re the best ones at it.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_19.dragonia.step3":"It’s good to be back. We had our rest and now it’s time to finish this!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_20.dragonia.step1":"I never thought I would say this but I’m exhausted. The bigger the tree gets the harder it becomes to grow it.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_20.dragonia.step2":"Maybe we should ask Zafira for help?","UnitStory.drbattlepass_20.dragonia.step3":"The dragon keeper? She hates my guts. She would rather see us fail than reach out a helping hand.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_20.dragonia.step4":"If there is anything this journey taught us it’s that it’s dangerous to jump to conclusions. Let us talk to her!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_21.dragonia.step1":"You need my help? Not in a million years!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_21.dragonia.step2":"Wouldn’t you do anything to save your home? Look how hard you’re trying to protect it now.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_21.dragonia.step3":"I’ll admit, I underestimated you and your king. Maybe you’re worthy of the tree of life.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_21.dragonia.step4":"Even if we aren’t, the citizens of the Kingdom deserve to be rescued. You’re their last hope!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_22.dragonia.step1":"Welcome aboard, Zafira. We’re forever in your debt.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_22.dragonia.step2":"Don’t thank me yet. It’s tricky to fully grow the tree of life.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_22.dragonia.step3":"That’s why we’re so lucky to have you on our side. Just tell us what to do.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_23.dragonia.step1":"I must say, you work pretty well as a team.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_23.dragonia.step2":"Well, thank you. You’re welcome to join us anytime.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_23.dragonia.step3":"I appreciate the offer, but I prefer working alone.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_23.dragonia.step4":"I used to be like that too when I was your age. Just know that our doors are always open to you.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_24.dragonia.step1":"We’re almost there. No one has ever gotten so close to harnessing the power of the tree. You must be pretty special.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_24.dragonia.step2":"We’re just a bunch of guys trying to do their best to save their people.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_24.dragonia.step3":"This is more than enough. Let’s see where it gets you!","UnitStory.drbattlepass_25.dragonia.step1":"We did it! The kingdom is safe now. I thank you all for the fantastic job you did despite all the obstacles.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_25.dragonia.step2":"We thank you too, your majesty. If it wasn’t for your command, the Kingdom wouldn’t survive these dark times.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_25.dragonia.step3":"It was nice getting to know your lot. Feel free to visit us any time you want. I guess, the dragons will miss youю Maybe not only dragons.","UnitStory.drbattlepass_25.dragonia.step4":"We’ll miss you too. We promise to come back once things settle down in the Kingdom.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_0.step1":"We were sent here to find some great treasure. Is this piece of wood a joke?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_0.step2":"Don’t give up just yet, lads. Let’s keep looking. Even if you don’t find anything, try to enjoy yourself.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_1.step1":"I didn’t know that Atlanteans valued logs more than gold. Time made us greedier.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_1.step2":"Don’t be so dramatic. There is got to be an explanation for all that.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_1.step3":"I would sacrifice one of my meals to hear it!","UnitStory.seabattlepass_2.step1":"Since you were the one who told us about the magic tridents and this special place, we would like to know some more.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_2.step2":"Yes, what are we really doing here? And where is the treasure?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_2.step3":"I had a vision. It said that we needed to come here. That we will find indescribable riches here. That’s all I know. And I need your help to understand the rest.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_3.step1":"So, what are we supposed to do?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_3.step2":"Let's just keep on examining this boat and see what we can make of it.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_4.step1":"Don’t you find it hard working when everything around you is covered with uncertainty?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_4.step2":"On the contrary. I’m at my best when you put me on the brink of new discoveries. So let’s roll up our sleeves and find out the truth!","UnitStory.seabattlepass_5.step1":"Sire, aren’t you worried about the team? They started to ask questions.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_5.step2":"I’m always worried about my people because I have their best interests at heart.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_5.step3":"I’ll try my best to keep them in the dark but they’ll find out the truth eventually.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_5.step4":"In that case, let’s use the time we have left wisely.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_6.step1":"Aren’t you curious how did this thing end up underwater?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_6.step2":"Not really. Vessels sink and it’s inevitable. I just hope that all of the crew members made it to safety.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_7.step1":"I’m starting to think that I’ll not get a chance to rest ever again.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_7.step2":"What makes you believe that?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_7.step3":"I don’t know… Maybe the fact that we’re constantly exploring peculiar places? First, floating island full of dragons, and now this…","UnitStory.seabattlepass_7.step4":"You have nothing to complain about, my friend. Being a pioneer is the noblest thing in the world!","UnitStory.seabattlepass_8.step1":"How is it going, lads?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_8.step2":"I have to admit, sire, it’s not easy to keep looking for something that you’ve never seen before.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_8.step3":"But this is the only way to discover truly astonishing things.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_9.step1":"Is it possible to get tired underwater?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_9.step2":"It’s a tricky question. On one hand, you have more resistance. On the other, you experience a certain level of weightlessness which…","UnitStory.seabattlepass_9.step3":"Not tricky at all! I’m tired and I think we should ask for help.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_10.step1":"Hey, Grizzly, I know that it’s unconventional for a strong man like myself to ask for help but here we are…","UnitStory.seabattlepass_10.step2":"Sure, no problem. But I got to finish my research first. Trust me, you’ll be blown away when I reveal my findings to you.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_10.step3":"You know how to make me want to work even harder!","UnitStory.seabattlepass_11.step1":"Are you ready, guys? Prepare to be amazed!","UnitStory.seabattlepass_11.step2":"Sure. I doubt that anything can surprise me at this point.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_11.step3":"How about this then? The tridents we’ve been collecting are being fetched from the future!","UnitStory.seabattlepass_11.step4":"I need some time to process what you just said. Do get back to me when I’m done being shocked.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_12.step1":"What’s that? It doesn’t look like your normal ship.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_12.step2":"Remember what I said about the tridents being from the future?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_12.step3":"I do remember it but I still don’t get it.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_12.step4":"Let’s find more evidence before I try to interpret my findings for you.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_13.step1":"Are you saying that both the tridents and the ships come from the future?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_13.step2":"Yes and no. This ship is sitting on a portal that can transport any vessel from any given point in time. It was discovered by the people of Atlantis and caused the entire city to flood.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_13.step3":"Did you get all that just from studying the tridents?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_13.step4":"Not exactly. I still have some questions myself so I suggest we share this information with the King. He is a wise man who might know something.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_14.step1":"Sire, Grizzly discovered something extraordinary about this whole place.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_14.step2":"Yes, your highness. I believe that we might be dealing with time travel here.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_14.step3":"Sounds very interesting indeed. Why don’t you go and study it a little bit more while I gather my thoughts?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_15.step1":"Didn’t you find the king’s reaction strange?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_15.step2":"To be fair, it’s a strange concept to wrap your head around. Let’s give him time while we continue our search.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_16.step1":"I’m afraid that the time has come. The genie is out of the bottle.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_16.step2":"Do they know the whole truth?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_16.step3":"Not yet. But it’s just a matter of time before they find out about the actual reason why we’re here.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_17.step1":"Things just got more interesting. Remember I told you that the tridents were from the future? It turns out they were made by us at the kingdom.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_17.step2":"But how is that possible?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_17.step3":"I think that this is the question we have to address to the person who produced them…","UnitStory.seabattlepass_18.step1":"You told us that you knew nothing about this place! That it was just a vision and that you needed our help… Why would you lie to us?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_18.step2":"I did see a vision. Not of Atlantis, though, but of our Kingdom. It was covered by water. I had to do something to prevent it. We’ve already lost our home once, I didn’t want for it to happen again.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_19.step1":"So, this treasure you told us about… Was it also a lie?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_19.step2":"No. This was the most honest thing I could say to you.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_19.step3":"Where is it, then? We scoured the whole bottom of the sea but found nothing.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_19.step4":"Haven’t you? Nothing can’t be more precious than securing the well-being of your homeland.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_20.step1":"I still don’t get it. How finding all of these ships will help us save the Kingdom?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_20.step2":"The god of water has some unfinished business here. If we finish what did locals started his desire will be fulfilled.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_20.step3":"Uncover the rest of Atlantis and bring all of the sunk ships back to life. Sounds like a plan!","UnitStory.seabattlepass_21.step1":"As a science enthusiast, I have one question left. How did you make the tridents that could unlock the Atlantis?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_21.step2":"I had to read a lot of books and cast a lot of spells to find the right one.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_21.step3":"So, there was nothing scientific about it?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_21.step4":"Unfortunately, not.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_21.step5":"Maybe I should consider repurposing.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_22.step1":"Did you know the truth all along, sire?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_22.step2":"I did. The enchantress came to me with her vision and we devised a plan but we had to keep it a secret to avoid any panic in our midst. I’m sorry you had to find out this way.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_22.step3":"Not at all, your highness. Thankfully, we have enough time left to put your plan to action.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_23.step1":"Will you ever be able to come near water again?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_23.step2":"To be honest, I enjoyed every little bit of our undersea adventure. Plus it’s a great place to visit when you want to take a break from the bustling kingdom grounds.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_23.step3":"That’s good because we’ll definitely have to come back here occasionally to check if everything is okay.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_24.step1":"What if there is actually a chest full of gold somewhere here?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_24.step2":"When did you stop carrying so much about food and become obsessed with material possessions?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_24.step3":"It’s impossible to think about food when you’re surrounded by seaweed. I had to sublimate.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_25.step1":"We did it! All the ships are saved. So is the Kingdom.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_25.step2":"Great job you all! As always, however.","UnitStory.seabattlepass_25.step3":"Thank you, your highness. I wonder what other adventures life will bestow on us?","UnitStory.seabattlepass_25.step4":"No matter what it is, we’ll be ready!","UnitStory.gnomes_9.step1":"They’re about to light the barrel up. Is it finally time to do something?","UnitStory.gnomes_9.step2":"Yes. Let’s interfere and see what they have to say for themselves.","UnitStory.gnomes_10.step1":"Who are you and what do you think you are doing?","UnitStory.gnomes_10.step2":"I’m Bob. And this is Big. We’re heisting the Royal Treasury.","UnitStory.gnomes_10.step3":"It’s a funny joke. I never heard of it before.","UnitStory.gnomes_10.step4":"Come with us, Big and Bob, there are a few things we need to discuss.","UnitStory.sand_9.step1":"What a wonderful villa we built. And look at these palm trees! I wonder how many coconuts are on them. Oops, sorry.","UnitStory.sand_9.step2":"It’s okay. You don’t have to change who you are because of me… ","UnitStory.sand_9.step3":"You're absolutely right! And you don’t have to change who you are either. I’ve got a solution.","UnitStory.sand_11.step1":"Here you go, Grizzly. We turned the sand you found into something magical.","UnitStory.sand_11.step2":"Speaking of magic, the elixir is ready. You can drink it anytime you feel hungry. It has all the nutrients and vitamins and the best thing is… It helps you lose weight!","UnitStory.sand_11.step3":"I don’t know what to say, Grizzly… This is amazing!","UnitStory.sand_11.step4":"Don’t mention it. I hope it gives you enough strength to take on another challenge!","UnitStory.caravanship_0.step1":"Do you know what time is it? It's best offer o'clock!","UnitStory.caravanship_0.step2":"Is the Eastern Caravan on its way? This is our chance to buy goods with huge discounts.","UnitStory.caravanship_0.step3":"Yes, and we need to hurry up, since it's only in town for a couple of days...","UnitStory.asia_9.step1":"To be honest, I’m starting to understand why the emperor liked staying at the castle.","UnitStory.asia_9.step2":"Hold your horses, cowboy. It’s not yet it. Trust me, you’ll know when you see it.","UnitStory.asia_11.step1":"Can you see the difference between the castle and the rest of the terracotta buildings now?","UnitStory.asia_11.step2":"Oh yeah. It is indeed huge and gorgeous. I hope it will serve the people of the kingdom well!","UnitStory.kraken_0.step1":"I didn't know that there were giant squids in our waters.","UnitStory.kraken_0.step2":"I bet you also didn't know that we can use the keys to fight evil spirits. Let me show you how it's done!","UnitStory.cinema_0.step1":"Do you want to see something cool?","UnitStory.cinema_0.step2":"Please, don’t say that it’s another deposit that you’ve found. I’m tired of building things, I just want to kick back and relax.","UnitStory.cinema_0.step3":"To be honest, I’m not sure what it is yet, but I was hoping you would help me find out.","UnitStory.cinema_1.step1":"I also found this. If it helps…","UnitStory.cinema_1.step2":"Not really. If anything, it makes everything more complicated. I don’t know what should we do next.","UnitStory.cinema_1.step3":"Well, you know what they say. When something doesn’t make sense, reach out to the giant bear in the armor.","UnitStory.cinema_2.step1":"Sorry to bother you, Grizzly, but we need your expertise. It seems like we stumbled upon a peculiar item from the future…","UnitStory.cinema_2.step2":"You lads are silly! It’s actually from the past because I’ve been working on it for a few weeks already.","UnitStory.cinema_2.step3":"Really? What is it for? What does it do? Is it edible?","UnitStory.cinema_2.step4":"Enough with the questions. It’s something designed to be seen, not talked about. I better show it to you!","UnitStory.cinema_3.step1":"A place to kick back and relax and get rewarded on top of that? The dream came true!","UnitStory.cinema_3.step2":"I’m glad that you like it. I thought we did great with refurbishing the Kingdom, so we deserve a place to rest.","UnitStory.cinema_3.step3":"Indeed we do! Come on, let’s take a look at the rewards we can get for using this magical device!","UnitStory.bank_0.step1":"I have exciting news to share with you, lads! You helped to get the Kingdom up from its knees, and now I want you to cut the ribbon at the opening of the Royal Bank.","UnitStory.bank_0.step2":"The opening of the Royal Bank, sire? What does this mean for our Kingdom?","UnitStory.bank_0.step3":"It means that now everyone has an opportunity to deposit their views and earn the rewards.","UnitStory.bank_0.step4":"How exciting! Let’s try it now and collect the interest.","UnitStory.fog_fog4_0.step1":"You're probably trying your best but you are doing everything wrong.","UnitStory.fog_fog4_0.step2":"Am I? Come on then, show me how it is done, Mr Know It All!","UnitStory.fog_fog4_0.step3":"The more pieces you merge at once, the more items you get as a result.","UnitStory.fog_fog4_0.step4":"Enough words, let's test your theory in practice!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_0.step1":"Um, sire, would you be so kind as to tell us why are we back here? And of what interest are these ruins to us?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_0.step2":"Please don’t say that the kingdom is in trouble. Again.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_0.step3":"One thing past experience taught me is to be honest with my men, so I won’t say that the kingdom is in trouble.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_0.step4":"Say something, though, please. You can’t see me sweat here but I am pretty nervous!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_1.step1":"Although the Kingdom is not in trouble, we should always be on the lookout for threats and strengthen our alliances.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_1.step2":"We want to be prepared by helping rebuild Atlantis and placing one of our strategic headquarters here. We have 20 days to do that.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_1.step3":"Building an underwater fort on such short notice sounds like a hard thing to do. Although I’d love a challenge, I can’t do it without you. Will you help me?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_1.step4":"Of course, Grizzly, if there is one thing past experience taught us, it is that it’s easier to carry heavy materials underwater than it is on land.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_2.step1":"Are you happy to be back? The local architecture looks very authentic.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_2.step2":"On one hand, I just dried off from the last time. On the other one, I had a blast saving Atlantis.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_2.step3":"And they say that you can’t walk into the same river twice…","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_2.step4":"Technically, it’s not a river. So we should be good!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_3.step1":"Do you really think we can build a fort here? Saving sunken vessels is one thing, subaquatic construction is completely another.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_3.step2":"I wouldn’t have taken on this challenge if I hadn’t had you by my side.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_3.step3":"It’s good that the pressure feels differently underwater. Otherwise, my hands would be shaking right now.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_4.step1":"Will you consider moving here if the building turns out alright?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_4.step2":"First of all, there are no ifs. It will be great! And secondly, why not? I can be the Gatekeeper of Atlantis.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_4.step3":"You know what? This is probably the fanciest way to call a night watchman. Good for you!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_5.step1":"How is the construction going?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_5.step2":"Everything is great, your highness. We’re making history here. All thanks to you!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_5.step3":"I am nothing more than a reflection of the people of the Kingdom.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_5.step4":"With a mirror like you, sire, our future will always look bright.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_6.step1":"I’ve been thinking, what if we build an aquarium on our island and call it the Atlantic quarters?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_6.step2":"Are you getting attached to the local fish?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_6.step3":"No. I don’t know. Maybe a little bit.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_6.step4":"Don’t worry, you can always come and stay here whenever you feel like visiting them.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_7.step1":"Do you find undersea construction easier? After all, the water is doing all the heavy lifting.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_7.step2":"I always told you that if you work with your head, you can always make things easier for you, be it land or water.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_7.step3":"Anyway, I am glad that we were able to build this stunner so fast.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_8.step1":"Are we still on schedule? I am not trying to push you. Just wondering if everything is going according to the plan.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_8.step2":"Let me run a few tests, your highness. This will help me evaluate the progress.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_8.step3":"Sure thing, Grizzly. The building does look great so I can’t wait to see it finished!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_9.step1":"Is everything okay, Grizzly? You look less cheerful than usual.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_9.step2":"Everything is fine. At least for now. I have a reason to worry but it hasn’t been confirmed yet. Just keep going, you’re doing great!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_10.step1":"Guys, I think we might have a problem.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_10.step2":"What is it, Grizzly? You thought they were little honey bubbles but they turned out to be caviar?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_10.step3":"I have a reason to believe that our materials aren’t suitable for underwater construction.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_11.step1":"I think you just worry too much. This building looks just fine.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_11.step2":"I ran some extended tests that showed that it will be washed out over time.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_11.step3":"Should we stop the construction?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_11.step4":"No. We’ve come too far already. I just need to find a way to alter the destruction process.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_12.step1":"I must admit, I became attached to our headquarters. And it’s not even finished yet.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_12.step2":"Me too. Do you think Grizzly will find a solution?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_12.step3":"I hope so. This brilliant mind of his will definitely figure something out!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_13.step1":"I heard of the problem, Grizzly. How are you doing?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_13.step2":"News travels fast, your highness. It’s not my brightest moment but I’ll try my best to find the solution.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_13.step3":"I have an idea. Let’s gather the team to discuss it.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_14.step1":"You wanted to see us, sire?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_14.step2":"First of all, the building looks amazing.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_14.step3":"Thank you, your highness. There is a caveat, though…","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_14.step4":"I know. That’s why we are all here. We must all do our best if we want to succeed.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_15.step1":"What are you suggesting, your highness?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_15.step2":"I know that our Grizzly is very bright and capable but it’s impossible to come up with the required solution while being underwater without proper tools.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_15.step3":"He should go back to the island and work on the formula in his laboratory while I take over the construction in his stead.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_15.step4":"Thank you, your highness. You’re the best leader anyone can wish for!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_16.step1":"I know that you're great, your highness, but do you think we can manage without Grizzly?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_16.step2":"I look at what you accomplished so far and do not doubt our success. Not even for a second! It can easily change, though, if we keep talking instead of working.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_16.step3":"Roger that!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_17.step1":"I can confirm that Grizzly has reached the island safely and buried himself in the lab under books whose titles I can’t even read.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_17.step2":"We appreciate the update, Sir Mergelot. Do you like what you see?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_17.step3":"Let me put it this way, your highness. It will be a tragedy if Grizzly doesn’t find a solution.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_18.step1":"Even if we can’t find a way to make this building last forever, I really enjoyed constructing it.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_18.step2":"Agreed! But if justice exists, then it will prevail!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_19.step1":"Any news from Grizzly, sir Mergelot?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_19.step2":"I am afraid not, sire. Nobody has left or entered the laboratory since we last spoke.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_19.step3":"Alright then. This building deserves to be finished anyway. Let’s make it the best we can. The rest is not up to us.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_20.step1":"There is still work left to do but not that much time left. I think it’s my turn to roll up my sleeves.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_20.step2":"Are you sure, your highness? We can try to be faster.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_20.step3":"I’m afraid it won’t help, you’re already giving it your everything.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_21.step1":"I can’t believe my eyes! What are you doing, sire?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_21.step2":"Just trying to be a part of the team. The greatest team I’ve had a chance to work with!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_22.step1":"Sorry to interrupt you, your highness. But there is news. News you would like to hear.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_22.step2":"It’s better to be good, Sir Mergelot. I was quite enjoying myself on the construction site. Look at that beauty!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_22.step3":"It’s Grizzly, sire. He is coming back as fast as he can.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_23.step1":"How do you like the news, lads?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_23.step2":"It’s great, sire! Did he come up with a solution?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_23.step3":"This is something we have to hear from him.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_23.step4":"Let's welcome him back with our best work, then!","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_24.step1":"Grizzly! It’s so good to see you. Even if this building turns to dust tomorrow.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_24.step2":"I am happy to see you too. And don’t you worry about the building. It took longer than I expected, but the formula is ready. We just need to apply it.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_25.step1":"What a fantastic job, lads. All of you! I know that I said it a million times already, but you’re the best team a king can wish for.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_25.step2":"Thank you, sire! It’s an honor to be a part of this union.","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_25.step3":"And to work alongside a genius! How were you able to turn things around, Grizzly?","UnitStory.sea2battlepass_25.step4":"I don’t want to bore you with the details. Let’s just say that I had no option to fail since you were doing the best you can!","UnitStory.sea2tournament_0.step1":"I know we are busy building the headquarters but I bet I can beat you in a race!","UnitStory.sea2tournament_0.step2":"You can beat me? Please. Any snail will be faster than you.","UnitStory.sea2tournament_0.step3":"Why don't you both pick a snail and find out whose pet is faster?","UnitStory.sea2tournament_0.step4":"What a splendid idea. And I shall nominate the reward for the winner. Consider Atlantic games open!","UnitStory.shark_9.step1":"Look what we found while installing the nets.","UnitStory.shark_9.step2":"It’s a captain’s hat. I guess our fish is bigger than we thought.","UnitStory.shark_9.step3":"We should be extra careful, then. Forget what I said about the dynamite. Whatever it takes to catch him!","UnitStory.shark_10.step1":"Gotcha!","UnitStory.shark_10.step2":"You have the right to remain silent. In case you can talk.","UnitStory.shark_10.step3":"Great job, everyone. Now, let’s find out who this is and what he is doing here.","UnitStory.warcraft_10.step1":"I already like it. But can we make it even bigger? I am thinking four times as big.","UnitStory.warcraft_10.step2":"What are we going to do with all this space?","UnitStory.warcraft_10.step3":"I was thinking about a separate chamber for the pond of your dreams. In case you're willing to give it all up, the current size works.","UnitStory.warcraft_12.step1":"I am so proud of us, guys. Time passes by but we are still the best at what we do.","UnitStory.warcraft_12.step2":"Couldn’t agree more. Fantastic team effort and well-deserved success.","UnitStory.warcraft_12.step3":"The question is, will Grizzly be able to penetrate the impenetrable fortress to get to his raspberry honey haven?","UnitStory.fish_9.step1":"Look at this advanced fish tank I discovered! It seems to be equipped with some sort of robotic technology. And... there's a fish inside!","UnitStory.fish_9.step2":"That be Cyber Fin! Someone must have captured her and trapped her in this tank!","UnitStory.fish_9.step3":"With the items we've found, Alvin and I can design and assemble a new robotic tank for Cyber Fin to reside in when on land.","UnitStory.fish_9.step4":"Gather everything we've found, and let's prepare to rescue Cyber Fin. Our journey has led us to this moment, and we must be ready for whatever comes our way.","UnitStory.fish_10.step1":"Thanks to ye all, Cyber Fin is safe now! She can even voice her thoughts. I couldn't have done it without ye.","UnitStory.fish_10.step2":"Thank you, my friends. I've been held captive for far too long.","UnitStory.fish_10.step3":"Cyber Fin, what happened to you? How did you end up in that fish tank?","UnitStory.fish_10.step4":"It's a long story, and there's more to it than you can imagine. A great danger lies ahead, and we must prepare for the storm that is coming...","UnitStory.fish_10.step5":"Then we shall face this danger together. For now, welcome to our team, Cyber Fin. Let's make the Mergest Kingdom even greater, and brace ourselves for the challenges that await us.","UnitStory.steampunk_10.step1":"The Cosmic Voyager... this ship can withstand the harshest conditions of space travel.","UnitStory.steampunk_10.step2":"And it is designed to cover immense distances. We are about to embark on a truly grand journey.","UnitStory.steampunk_10.step3":"We've come this far, I can hardly believe what we're achieving.","UnitStory.steampunk_10.step4":"And it all started with a handful of spare parts. The Universe is waiting, my friends!","UnitStory.steampunk_12.step1":"Behold, the Celestial Chariot! A machine built for the stars, a key to unlock our universe.","UnitStory.steampunk_12.step2":"Let's not rush into launching it. This chariot is a masterpiece of ancient technology, there might be more secrets to uncover.","UnitStory.steampunk_12.step3":"I agree with CyberFin. We must study this marvel first. It represents a grand step in our journey, but we must tread carefully","UnitStory.steampunk_12.step4":"Indeed, who knows what other doors this chariot might open for us? The Universe is vast, my friends. Let's prepare to embrace it.","UnitStory.steampunk_12.step5":"Wait! There's something etched here in the ancient language... It says... 'Beware the...' The rest is obscured. I believe our journey is just beginning!","UnitStory.moonstone_11.step1":"Look at this! It seems to be following the same geometric principles as our earlier findings, but it's clearly more intricate. Is it me, or does this look like a key?","UnitStory.moonstone_11.step2":"A key? I can sense a strong power coming from it. Maybe it's not just a key but a 'bridge'... A bridge to another realm?","UnitStory.moonstone_11.step3":"Whatever it is, it's beautiful! Makes me want to write a love ballad about it!","UnitStory.moonstone_11.step4":"Careful, we still don't know what we're dealing with here. Let's not make hasty assumptions.","UnitStory.moonstone_11.step5":"Indeed, CyberFin. But we are closer to understanding than we have ever been before. Let's not waver in our resolve now!","UnitStory.moonstone_11.step6":"Right you are, my King! To the final piece of the puzzle!","UnitStory.moonstone_13.step1":"Incredible! This... This is unlike anything we've ever seen before. It's... a lunar platform?","UnitStory.moonstone_13.step2":"By all the laws of science, this should not be possible, yet here it is, floating right before our eyes. We have much to learn from this.","UnitStory.moonstone_13.step3":"The Moon Stones, they are arranged in some kind of pattern. Do you see it? Could this be the 'bridge' the Enchantress spoke of?","UnitStory.moonstone_13.step4":"I feel a surge of magic like nothing else. This platform... it's not just made of moonstones. It's a celestial gateway!","UnitStory.moonstone_13.step5":"Could this be the final step to fully awakening the Celestial Carriage?","UnitStory.moonstone_13.step6":"Only one way to find out!","UnitStory.panda_9.step1":"This suit... It's ancient, but in excellent condition. Woven with armoured thread, too. She must have been a warrior of some kind.","UnitStory.panda_9.step2":"Yes, and more than that. Legend has it, Luna Bamboo was born under a glowing bamboo shoot in the heart of the forest. Anointed by the spirits, she was deemed their protector. Every item we found was touched by her divine grace.","UnitStory.panda_9.step3":"Born under a glowing bamboo shoot? Divine grace? These sound like fairy tales, CyberFin.","UnitStory.panda_9.step4":"Fairy tales often carry the seeds of truth, Grizzly. Our world is full of mystery and wonder.","UnitStory.panda_9.step5":"Well, whether it's a fairy tale or not, I must say... I'm intrigued to meet this Luna Bamboo.","UnitStory.panda_10.step1":"Well, here she is... The legendary Luna Bamboo.","UnitStory.panda_10.step2":"It's been a while since anyone sought me out. I welcome you, brave seekers. You must have traveled far.","UnitStory.panda_10.step3":"Uh... uh...","UnitStory.panda_10.step4":"Grizzly, remember why we're here?","UnitStory.panda_10.step5":"Yes, Luna Bamboo, we have come seeking your wisdom. We need your help in unraveling a mystery of CyberFin's capture. We hope you could guide us.","UnitStory.panda_10.step6":"A quest, then? Very well. Let's see what wisdom I can offer.","UnitStory.thanksgiving_0.step1":"Look at this! It is a new item! But how did it appear and what to do with it?","UnitStory.thanksgiving_0.step2":"This is a Thanksgiving item. Merge any objects from level two and above to receive Thanksgiving items, and when you collect all of them, you'll get a new unique landmark!

Once a beacon of Christmas magic, now dimmed and quiet.","UnitStory.xmcustomermain3_0.step2":"It used to light up the entire island with its festive glow. Now, it barely casts a shadow in the moonlight.","UnitStory.xmcustomermain3_0.step3":"Imagine if we could reignite its brilliance. The tower could again be a symbol of hope and celebration, visible from every corner of the island.","UnitStory.xmcustomermain3_0.step4":"Restoring the Starlight Tower is more than fixing a structure; it's about bringing back a guiding light to Christmas Island.","UnitStory.xmcustomermain3_0.step5":"Let's make it shine again. The brighter it glows, the more it will lift the spirits of everyone here.","UnitStory.xmcustomermain4_0.step1":"Look, Santa's Sleigh!
